2 50 IMDG Code (incorporating Amendment 40-20) Chapter 2.1 Class 1 – Explosives 2.1.0 Introductory notes (these notes are not mandatory) Note 1: Class 1 is a restricted class, that is, only those explosive substances and articles that are listed in the Dangerous Goods List in chapter 3 2 may be accepted for transport However, the competent authorities retain the right by mutual agreement to approve transport of explosive substances and articles for special purposes under special conditions Therefore entries have been included in the Dangerous Goods List for “Substances, explosive, not otherwise specified” and “Articles, explosive, not otherwise specified” It is intended that these entries should only be used when no other method of operation is possible Note 2: General entries such as “Explosive, blasting, type A” are used to allow for the transport of new substances In preparing these provisions, military ammunition and explosives have been taken into consideration to the extent that they are likely to be transported by commercial carriers Note 3: A number of substances and articles in class 1 are described in appendix B These descriptions are given because a term may not be well-known or may be at variance with its usage for regulatory purposes Note 4: Class 1 is unique in that the type of packaging frequently has a decisive effect on the hazard and therefore on the assignment to a particular division The correct division is determined by use of the procedures provided in this chapter 2.1.1 Definitions and general provisions 2.1.1.1 Class 1 comprises: .1 explosive substances (a substance which is not itself an explosive but which can form an explosive atmosphere of gas, vapour or dust is not included in class 1), except those which are too dangerous to transport or those where the predominant hazard is one appropriate to another class; .2 explosive articles, except devices containing explosive substances in such quantity or of such a character that their inadvertent or accidental ignition or initiation during transport shall not cause any effect external to the device either by projection, fire, smoke, heat or loud noise (see 2 1 3 4); and .3 substances and articles not mentioned under 1 and 2 which are manufactured with a view to producing a practical explosive or pyrotechnic effect 2.1.1.2 Transport of explosive substances which are unduly sensitive, or so reactive as to be subject to spontaneous reaction, is prohibited 2.1.1.3 Definitions For the purposes of this Code, the following definitions apply: .1 Explosive substance means a solid or liquid substance (or a mixture of substances) which is in itself capable by chemical reaction of producing gas at such a temperature and pressure and at such a speed as to cause damage to the surroundings Pyrotechnic substances are included even when they do not evolve gases .2 Pyrotechnic substance means a substance or a mixture of substances designed to produce an effect by heat, light, sound, gas or smoke or a combination of these as the result of non-detonative self-sustaining exothermic chemical reactions .3 Explosive article means an article containing one or more explosive substances .4 Mass explosion means one which affects almost the entire load virtually instantaneously .5 Phlegmatized means that a substance (or “phlegmatizer”) has been added to an explosive to enhance its safety in handling and transport The phlegmatizer renders the explosive insensitive, or less sensitive, to the following actions: heat, shock, impact, percussion or friction Typical phlegmatizing agents include, but are not limited to: wax, paper, water, polymers (such as chlorofluoropolymers), alcohol and oils (such as petroleum jelly and paraffin) Non-commercial use only MSC 102/24/Add.2 Annex 4, page 61

Chapter 2.1 – Class 1 – Explosives 51 IMDG Code (incorporating Amendment 40-20) 2 2.1.1.4 Hazard divisions The six hazard divisions of class 1 are: Division 1 1 Substances and articles which have a mass explosion hazard Division 1 2 Substances and articles which have a projection hazard but not a mass explosion hazard Division 1 3 Substances and articles which have a fire hazard and either a minor blast hazard or a minor projection hazard or both, but not a mass explosion hazard This division comprises substances and articles: 1 which give rise to considerable radiant heat; or 2 which burn one after another, producing minor blast or projection effects or both Division 1 4 Substances and articles which present no significant hazard This division comprises substances and articles which present only a small hazard in the event of ignition or initiation during transport The effects are largely confined to the package and no projection of fragments of appreciable size or range is to be expected An external fire must not cause virtually instantaneous explosion of almost the entire contents of the package Note: Substances and articles in this division are in compatibility group S if they are so packaged or designed that any hazardous effects arising from the accidental functioning are confined within the package unless the package has been degraded by fire, in which case all blast or projection effects are limited to the extent that they do not significantly hinder fire fighting or other emergency response efforts in the immediate vicinity of the package Division 1 5 Very insensitive substances which have a mass explosion hazard This division comprises substances which have a mass explosion hazard but are so insensitive that there is very little probability of initiation or of transition from burning to detonation under normal conditions of transport Note: The probability of transition from burning to detonation is greater when large quantities are transported in a ship As a consequence, the stowage provisions for explosive substances in division 1 1 and for those in division 1 5 are identical Division 1 6 Extremely insensitive articles which do not have a mass explosion hazard This division comprises articles which predominantly contain extremely insensitive substances and which demonstrate a negligible probability of accidental initiation or propagation Note: The hazard from articles of division 1 6 is limited to the explosion of a single article 2.1.1.5 Any substance or article having or suspected of having explosive characteristics shall first be considered for classification in class 1 in accordance with the procedures in 2 1 3 Goods are not classified in class 1 when: .1 unless specially authorized, the transport of an explosive substance is prohibited because sensitivity of the substance is excessive; .2 the substance or article comes within the scope of those explosive substances and articles which are specifically excluded from class 1 by the definition of this class; or .3 the substance or article has no explosive properties 2.1.2 Compatibility groups and classification codes 2.1.2.1 Goods of class 1 are considered to be “compatible” if they can be safely stowed or transported together without significantly increasing either the probability of an accident or, for a given quantity, the magnitude of the effects of such an accident By this criterion, goods listed in this class have been divided into a number of compatibility groups, each denoted by a letter from A to L (excluding I), N and S These are described in 2 1 2 2 and 2 1 2 3 Non-commercial use only MSC 102/24/Add.2 Annex 4, page 62

Chapter 2.3 – Class 3 – Flammable liquids 65 IMDG Code (incorporating Amendment 40-20) 2 2.3.3 Determination of flashpoint Note: The provisions of this section are not mandatory 2.3.3.1 The flashpoint of a flammable liquid is the lowest temperature of the liquid at which its vapour forms an ignitable mixture with air It gives a measure of the risk of formation of explosive or ignitable mixtures when the liquid escapes from its packing A flammable liquid cannot be ignited so long as its temperature remains below the flashpoint Note: Do not confuse the flashpoint with the ignition temperature, which is the temperature to which an explosive vapour–air mixture must be heated to cause actual explosion There is no relationship between the flashpoint and the ignition temperature 2.3.3.2 The flashpoint is not an exact physical constant for a given liquid It depends to some extent on the construction of the test apparatus used and on the testing procedure Therefore, when providing flashpoint data, specify the name of the test apparatus 2.3.3.3 Several standard apparatuses are in current use They all operate on the same principle: a specified quantity of the liquid is introduced into a receptacle at a temperature well below the flashpoint to be expected, then slowly heated; periodically, a small flame is brought near to the surface of the liquid The flashpoint is the lowest temperature at which a “flash” is observed 2.3.3.4 The test methods can be divided into two groups, depending on the use in an apparatus of an open receptacle (open-cup methods) or a closed one which is only opened to admit the flame (closed-cup methods) As a rule, the flashpoints found in an open-cup test are a few degrees higher than in a closed-cup test 2.3.3.5 In general, reproducibility in closed-cup apparatus is better than in open-cup 2.3.3.5.1 It is therefore recommended that flashpoints, especially in the range around 23 ° C, shall be determined by means of closed-cup (c c) methods 2.3.3.5.2 Flashpoint data in this Code are generally based on closed-cup methods In countries where it is customary to determine flashpoints by the open-cup method, the temperatures given by that method would need to be reduced to correspond with those in this Code 2.3.3.6 Determination of flashpoint The following methods for determining the flashpoint of flammable liquids may be used: International standards: ISO 1516 ISO 1523 ISO 2719 ISO 13736 ISO 3679 ISO 3680 National standards: American Society for Testing Materials International, 100 Barr Harbor Drive, PO Box C700, West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania, USA 19428-2959: ASTM D3828-07a, Standard Test Methods for Flash Point by Small Scale Closed Cup Tester ASTM D56-05, Standard Test Method for Flash Point by Tag Closed Cup Tester ASTM D3278-96(2004)e, Standard Test Methods for Flash Point of Liquids by Small Scale Closed-Cup Apparatus ASTM D93-08, Standard Test Methods for Flash Point by Pensky-Martens Closed Cup Tester Association française de normalisation, AFNOR, 11, rue Francis de Pressensé, 93571 La Plaine Saint-Denis Cedex: French Standard NF M 07-019 French Standards NF M 07-011/NF T 30-050/NF T 66-009 French Standard NF M 07-036 Deutsches Institut für Normung, Burggrafenstr 6, D-10787 Berlin: Standard DIN 51755 (flashpoints below 65 ° C) State Committee of the Council of Ministers for Standardization, 113813, GSP, Moscow, M-49 Leninsky Prospect, 9: GOST 12 1 044-84 Non-commercial use only MSC 102/24/Add.2 Annex 4, page 76

Chapter 2.9 – Miscellaneous dangerous substances and articles (Class 9) 133 IMDG Code (incorporating Amendment 40-20) 2 For the purposes of this section, Substance means chemical elements and their compounds in the natural state or obtained by any production process, including any additive necessary to preserve the stability of the product and any impurities deriving from the process used, but excluding any solvent which may be separated without affecting the stability of the substance or changing its composition 2.9.3.1.2 The aquatic environment may be considered in terms of the aquatic organisms that live in the water, and the aquatic ecosystem of which they are part * The basis, therefore, of the identification of hazard is the aquatic toxicity of the substance or mixture, although this may be modified by further information on the degradation and bioaccumulation behaviour 2.9.3.1.3 While the following classification procedure is intended to apply to all substances and mixtures, it is recognized that in some cases, e g metals or poorly soluble inorganic compounds, special guidance will be necessary † 2.9.3.1.4 The following definitions apply for acronyms or terms used in this section: BCF bioconcentration factor; BOD biochemical oxygen demand; COD chemical oxygen demand; GLP good laboratory practices; EC x the concentration associated with x% response; EC 50 the effective concentration of substance that causes 50% of the maximum response; ErC 50 EC 50 in terms of reduction of growth; K ow octanol/water partition coefficient; LC 50 (50% lethal concentration) the concentration of a substance in water which causes the death of 50% (one half) in a group of test animals; L(E)C 50 LC 50 or EC 50 ; NOEC (no observed effect concentration) the test concentration immediately below the lowest tested concentration with statistically significant adverse effect The NOEC has no statistically significant adverse effect compared to the control; OECD Test Guidelines Test guidelines published by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) 2.9.3.2 Definitions and data requirements 2.9.3.2.1 The basic elements for classification of environmentally hazardous substances (aquatic environment) are: .1 acute aquatic toxicity; .2 chronic aquatic toxicity; .3 potential for or actual bioaccumulation; and .4 degradation (biotic or abiotic) for organic chemicals; 2.9.3.2.2 While data from internationally harmonized test methods are preferred, in practice, data from national methods may also be used where they are considered as equivalent In general, it has been agreed that freshwater and marine species toxicity data can be considered as equivalent data and are preferably to be derived using OECD Test Guidelines or equivalent according to the principles of good laboratory practices (GLP) Where such data are not available, classification shall be based on the best available data 2.9.3.2.3 Acute aquatic toxicity means the intrinsic property of a substance to be injurious to an organism in a short- term aquatic exposure to that substance Acute (short-term) hazard , for classification purposes, means the hazard of a chemical caused by its acute toxicity to an organism during short-term aquatic exposure to that chemical Acute aquatic toxicity shall normally be determined using a fish 96 h LC 50 (OECD Test Guideline 203 or equivalent), a crustacea species 48 h EC 50 (OECD Test Guideline 202 or equivalent) and/or an algal species 72 or 96 h EC 50 (OECD Test Guideline 201 or equivalent) These species are considered as surrogate for all * This does not address aquatic pollutants for which there may be a need to consider effects beyond the aquatic environment such as the impacts on human health, etc † This can be found in annex 10 of the GHS Non-commercial use only MSC 102/24/Add.2 Annex 4, page 144

Part 2 – Classification 140 IMDG Code (incorporating Amendment 40-20) 2 The equivalent toxicity thus reflects the fact that non-rapidly degrading substances are classified one hazard category level more “severe” than rapidly degrading substances The calculated equivalent toxicity shall be used to assign that portion of the mixture a long-term hazard category, in accordance with the criteria for rapidly degradable substances (table 2 9 1 (b)(ii)), which is then subsequently used in applying the summation method 2.9.3.4.5.3 When applying the additivity formula for part of the mixture, it is preferable to calculate the toxicity of this part of the mixture using for each ingredient toxicity values that relate to the same taxonomic group (i e fish, crustacea or algae) and then to use the highest toxicity (lowest value) obtained (i e use the most sensitive of the three groups) However, when toxicity data for each ingredient are not available in the same taxonomic group, the toxicity value of each ingredient shall be selected in the same manner that toxicity values are selected for the classification of substances, i e the higher toxicity (from the most sensitive test organism) is used The calculated acute and chronic toxicity shall then be used to classify this part of the mixture as Acute 1 and/or Chronic 1 or 2 using the same criteria described for substances 2.9.3.4.5.4 If a mixture is classified in more than one way, the method yielding the more conservative result shall be used 2.9.3.4.6 Summation method 2.9.3.4.6.1 Classification procedure 2.9.3.4.6.1.1 In general a more severe classification for mixtures overrides a less severe classification, e g a classification with Chronic 1 overrides a classification with Chronic 2 As a consequence the classification procedure is already completed if the results of the classification is Chronic 1 A more severe classification than Chronic 1 is not possible; therefore, it is not necessary to pursue the classification procedure further 2.9.3.4.6.2 Classification for category Acute 1 2.9.3.4.6.2.1 First, all ingredients classified as Acute 1 are considered If the sum of the concentrations (in %) of these ingredients is greater than or equal to 25% the whole mixture shall be classified as Acute 1 If the result of the calculation is a classification of the mixture as Acute 1, the classification process is completed 2.9.3.4.6.2.2 The classification of mixtures for acute hazards based on this summation of the concentrations of classified ingredients is summarized in table 2 9 3 below Table 2.9.3 – Classification of a mixture for acute hazards based on summation of the concentrations of classified ingredients Sum of the concentrations (in %) of ingredients classified as: Mixture is classified as: Acute 1 × M * ≥ 25% Acute 1 * For explanation of the M factor, see 2 9 3 4 6 4 2.9.3.4.6.3 Classification for categories Chronic 1 and 2 2.9.3.4.6.3.1 First, all ingredients classified as Chronic 1 are considered If the sum of the concentrations (in %) of these ingredients is greater than or equal to 25% the mixture shall be classified as Chronic 1 If the result of the calculation is a classification of the mixture as Chronic 1 the classification procedure is completed 2.9.3.4.6.3.2 In cases where the mixture is not classified as Chronic 1, classification of the mixture as Chronic 2 is considered A mixture shall be classified as Chronic 2 if 10 times the sum of the concentrations (in %) of all ingredients classified as Chronic 1 plus the sum of the concentrations (in %) of all ingredients classified as Chronic 2 is greater than or equal to 25% If the result of the calculation is classification of the mixture as Chronic 2, the classification process is completed 2.9.3.4.6.3.3 The classification of mixtures for long-term hazards based on this summation of the concentrations of classified ingredients is summarized in table 2 9 4 below Table 2.9.4 – Classification of a mixture for long-term hazards based on summation of the concentrations of classified ingredients Sum of the concentrations (in %) of ingredients classified as: Mixture classified as: Chronic 1 × M * ≥ 25% Chronic 1 ( M × 10 × Chronic 1) + Chronic 2 ≥ 25% Chronic 2 * For explanation of the M factor, see 2 9 3 4 6 4 Non-commercial use only MSC 102/24/Add.2 Annex 4, page 151

Chapter 2.9 – Miscellaneous dangerous substances and articles (Class 9) 141 IMDG Code (incorporating Amendment 40-20) 2 2.9.3.4.6.4 Mixtures with highly toxic ingredients 2.9.3.4.6.4.1 Acute 1 or Chronic 1 ingredients with acute toxicities well below 1 mg/L and/or chronic toxicities well below 0 1 mg/L (if non-rapidly degradable) and 0 01 mg/L (if rapidly degradable) may influence the toxicity of the mixture and are given increased weight in applying the summation method When a mixture contains ingredients classified as Acute 1 or Chronic 1, the tiered approach described in 2 9 3 4 6 2 and 2 9 3 4 6 3 shall be applied using a weighted sum by multiplying the concentrations of Acute 1 and Chronic 1 ingredients by a factor, instead of merely adding up the percentages This means that the concentration of Acute 1 in the left column of table 2 9 3 and the concentration of Chronic 1 in the left column of table 2 9 4 are multiplied by the appropriate multiplying factor The multiplying factors to be applied to these ingredients are defined using the toxicity value, as summarized in table 2 9 5 below Therefore, in order to classify a mixture containing Acute 1 and/or Chronic 1 ingredients, the classifier needs to be informed of the value of the M factor in order to apply the summation method Alternatively, the additivity formula (2 9 3 4 5 2) may be used when toxicity data are available for all highly toxic ingredients in the mixture and there is convincing evidence that all other ingredients, including those for which specific acute and/or chronic toxicity data are not available, are of low or no toxicity and do not significantly contribute to the environmental hazard of the mixture Table 2.9.5 – Multiplying factors for highly toxic ingredients of mixtures Acute toxicity M factor Chronic toxicity M factor L(E)C 50 value NOEC value NRD * ingredients RD † ingredients 0 1 < L(E)C 50 ≤ 1 1 0 01 < NOEC ≤ 0 1 1 – 0 01 < L(E)C 50 ≤ 0 1 10 0 001 < NOEC ≤ 0 01 10 1 0 001 < L(E)C 50 ≤ 0 01 100 0 0001 < NOEC ≤ 0 001 100 10 0 0001 < L(E)C 50 ≤ 0 001 1,000 0 00001 < NOEC ≤ 0 0001 1,000 100 0 00001 < L(E)C 50 ≤ 0 0001 10,000 0 000001 < NOEC ≤ 0 00001 10,000 1,000 (continue in factor 10 intervals) (continue in factor 10 intervals) * Non-rapidly degradable † Rapidly degradable 2.9.3.4.6.5 Classification of mixtures with ingredients without any useable information 2.9.3.4.6.5.1 In the event that no useable information on acute and/or chronic aquatic toxicity is available for one or more relevant ingredients, it is concluded that the mixture cannot be attributed (a) definitive hazard category(ies) In this situation the mixture shall be classified based on the known ingredients only 2.9.4 Lithium batteries Cells and batteries, cells and batteries contained in equipment, or cells and batteries packed with equipment, containing lithium in any form shall be assigned to UN Nos 3090, 3091, 3480 or 3481 as appropriate They may be transported under these entries if they meet the following provisions: .1 Each cell or battery is of the type proved to meet the requirements of each test of the Manual of Tests and Criteria , part III, subsection 38 3 Cells and batteries manufactured according to a type meeting the requirements of subsection 38 3 of the Manual of Tests and Criteria , revision 3, amendment 1 or any subsequent revision and amendment applicable at the date of the type testing may continue to be transported, unless otherwise provided in this Code Cell and battery types only meeting the requirements of the Manual of Tests and Criteria , revision 3, are no longer valid However, cells and batteries manufactured in conformity with such types before 1 July 2003 may continue to be transported if all other applicable requirements are fulfilled Note: Batteries shall be of a type proved to meet the testing requirements of the Manual of Tests and Criteria , part III, subsection 38 3, irrespective of whether the cells of which they are composed are of a tested type .2 Each cell and battery incorporates a safety venting device or is designed to preclude a violent rupture under conditions normally incident to transport .3 Each cell and battery is equipped with an effective means of preventing external short circuits Non-commercial use only MSC 102/24/Add.2 Annex 4, page 152
