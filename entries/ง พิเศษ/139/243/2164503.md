reaction Chemical oxygen generators are used for the generation of oxygen for respiratory support, e g in aircraft, submarines, spacecraft, bomb shelters and breathing apparatus Oxidizing salts such as chlorates and perchlorates of lithium, sodium and potassium, which are used in chemical oxygen generators, evolve oxygen when heated These salts are mixed (compounded) with a fuel, usually iron powder, to form a chlorate candle, which produces oxygen by continuous reaction The fuel is used to generate heat by oxidation Once the reaction begins, oxygen is released from the hot salt by thermal decomposition (a thermal shield is used around the generator) A portion of the oxygen reacts with the fuel to produce more heat, which produces more oxygen, and so on Initiation of the reaction can be achieved by a percussion device, friction device or electric wire 3356 3357 NITROGLYCERIN MIXTURE, DESENSITIZED, LIQUID, N.O.S. with not more than 30% nitroglycerin, by mass 3 – II 274 288 0 E0 P099 –
