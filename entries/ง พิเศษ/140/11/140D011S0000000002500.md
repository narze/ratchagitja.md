MSC 102 / 24/Add.1 Annex 13 , page 4 MSC 102 - 24 - Add.1.docx PART A INTRODUCTION 1 The harmonized SOLAS regulations on subdivision and damage stability, as contained in SOLAS chapter II - 1, are based on a probabilistic concept which uses the probability of survival after collision as a measure of ships' safety in a damaged condition. This probability is referred to as the "attained subdivision index A " in the regulations. It can be considered an objective measure of ships' safety and, ideally, there would be no need to supplement this index by any deterministic requirements. 2 The philosophy behind the probabilistic concept is that two different ship s with the same attained index are of equal safety and, therefore, there is no need for special treatment of specific parts of the ship, even if they are able to survive different damages. The only areas which are given special attention in the regulations are the forward and bottom regions, which are dealt with by special subdivision rules provided for cases of ramming and grounding. 3 Only a few deterministic elements, which were necessary to make the concept practicable, have been included. It was also necessary to include a deterministic "minor damage" on top of the probabilistic regulations for passenger ships to avoid ships being designed with what might be perceived as unacceptably vulnerable spots in some part of their length. 4 It is easily reco gnized that there are many factors that will affect the final consequences of hull damage to a ship. These factors are random and their influence is different for ships with different characteristics. For example, it would seem obvious that in ships of sim ilar size carrying different amounts of cargo, damages of similar extents may lead to different results because of differences in the range of permeability and draught during service. The mass and velocity of the ramming ship is obviously another random va riable. 5 Owing to this, the effect of a three - dimensional damage to a ship with given watertight subdivision depends on the following circumstances: .1 which particular space or group of adjacent spaces is flooded; .2 the draught, trim and intact metacen tric height at the time of damage; .3 the permeability of affected spaces at the time of damage; .4 the sea state at the time of damage; and .5 other factors such as possible heeling moments owing to unsymmetrical weights. 6 Some of these circumstances are interdependent and the relationship between them and their effects may vary in different cases. Additionally, the effect of hull strength on penetration will obviously have some effect on the results for a given ship. Since the location and size of the damage is random, it is not possible to state which part of the ship becomes flooded. However, the probability of flooding a given space can be determined if the probability of occurrence of certain damages is known from experi ence, that is, damage statistics. The probability of flooding a space is then equal to the probability of occurrence of all such damages which just open the considered space to the sea. RESOLUTION MSC.429(98)/REV.1 (adopted on 11 November 2020) REVISED EXPLANATORY NOTES TO THE SOLAS CHAPTER II-1 SUBDIVISION AND DAMAGE STABILITY REGULATIONS

MSC 102 / 24/Add.1 Annex 13 , page 5 MSC 102 - 24 - Add.1.docx 7 For these reasons and because of mathematical complexity as well as insufficient data, it would not be practicable to make an exact or direct assessment of their effect on the probability that a particular ship will survive a random damage if it occurs. However, accepting some approximations or qualitative judgments, a lo gical treatment may be achieved by using the probability approach as the basis for a comparative method for the assessment and regulation of ship safety. 8 It may be demonstrated by means of probability theory that the probability of ship survival shoul d be calculated as the sum of probabilities of its survival after flooding each single compartment, each group of two, three, etc., adjacent compartments multiplied, respectively, by the probabilities of occurrence of such damages leading to the flooding o f the corresponding compartment or group of compartments. 9 If the probability of occurrence for each of the damage scenarios the ship could be subjected to is calculated and then combined with the probability of surviving each of these damages with the ship loaded in the most probable loading conditions, the attained index A as a measure for the ship's ability to sustain a collision damage can be determined . 10 It follows that the probability that a ship will remain afloat without sinking or capsizin g as a result of an arbitrary collision in a given longitudinal position can be broken down to: .1 the probability that the longitudinal centre of damage occurs in just the region of the ship under consideration; .2 the probability that this damage has a longitudinal extent that only includes spaces between the transverse watertight bulkheads found in this region; .3 the probability that the damage has a vertical extent that will flood only the spaces below a giv en horizontal boundary, such as a watertight deck; .4 the probability that the damage has a transverse penetration not greater than the distance to a given longitudinal boundary; and .5 the probability that the watertight integrity and the stability throughout the flooding sequence is sufficient to avoid c apsizing or sinking. 11 The first three of these factors are solely dependent on the watertight arrangement of the ship, while the last two depend on the ship's shape. The last factor also depends on the actual loading condition. By grouping these probabilities, calculations of t he probability of survival, or attained index A , have been formulated to include the following probabilities: .1 the probability of flooding each single compartment and each possible group of two or more adjacent compartments; and .2 the probability that the stability after flooding a compartment or a group of two or more adjacent compartments will be sufficient to prevent capsizing or dangerous heeling due to loss of stability or to heeling moments in intermediate or final stages of f looding. 12 This concept allows a rule requirement to be applied by requiring a minimum value of A for a particular ship. This minimum value is referred to as the "required subdivision index R " in the present regulations and can be made dependent on shi p size, number of passengers or other factors legislators might consider important.

MSC 102 / 24/Add.1 Annex 13 , page 6 MSC 102 - 24 - Add.1.docx 13 Evidence of compliance with the rules then simply becomes: A ≥ R 13.1 As explained above, the attained subdivision index A is determined by a formula for the entir e probability as the sum of the products for each compartment or group of compartments of the probability that a space is flooded, multiplied by the probability that the ship will not capsize or sink due to flooding of the considered space. In other words, the general formula for the attained index can be given in the form: A =  p i s i 13.2 Subscript " i " represents the damage zone (group of compartments) under consideration within the watertight subdivision of the ship. The subdivision is viewed in the l ongitudinal direction, starting with the aftmost zone/compartment. 13.3 The value of " p i " represents the probability that only the zone " i " under consideration will be flooded, disregarding any horizontal subdivision, but taking transverse subdivision into account. Longitudinal subdivision within the zone will result in additional flooding scenarios, each with its own probability of occurren ce. 13.4 The value of " s i " represents the probability of survival after flooding the zone " i " under consideration. 14 Although the ideas outlined above are very simple, their practical application in an exact manner would give rise to several difficult ies if a mathematically perfect method were to be developed. As pointed out above, an extensive but still incomplete description of the damage will include its longitudinal and vertical location as well as its longitudinal, vertical and transverse extent. Apart from the difficulties in handling such a five - dimensional random variable, it is impossible to determine its probability distribution very accurately with the presently available damage statistics. Similar limitations are true for the variables and physical relationships involved in the calcul ation of the probability that a ship will not capsize or sink during intermediate stages or in the final stage of flooding. 15 A close approximation of the available statistics would result in extremely numerous and complicated computations. In order to make the concept practicable, extensive simplifications are necessary. Although it is not possible to calculate the exact probability of survival on such a simplified basis, it has still been possible to develop a useful comparative measure of the merits of the longitudinal, transverse and horizontal subdivision of a ship.

However, if alterations or modifications of major character significantly impact the watertight subdivision of the ship, it should comply with the damage stability regulations in par t B - 1 applicable when the alterations or modifications of major character are carried out unless the Administration determines that this is not reasonable and practicable, in which case the attained subdivision index A should be raised above the original c onstruction required subdivision index R as much as practical. 3 Application of MSC.1/Circ.1246 is limited to cargo ships constructed before 1 January 2009. 4 A cargo ship constructed on or after 1 January 2009 of less than 80 m in length that is later lengthened beyond that limit should fully comply with the damage stability regulations according to its type and length. 5 If a passenger ship that has been in domestic service only and never been issued a SOLAS Passenger Ship Safety Certificate is conv erted to international service, for purposes of the stability requirements in parts B, B - 1, B - 2, B - 3 and B - 4 it should be treated as a passenger ship constructed on the date on which such a conversion commences.

For passenger ships it corresponds, in general, to the arrival condition with 10% consumables, a full complement of passengers and crew and their effects, and ballast as necessary for stability and trim. Any temporary ballast water exchange conditions for compliance with the International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships' Ballast Water and Sediments, 2004 or any non - service conditions, such as dry - dock ing, should not be taken as d l .

REGULATION 5 – INTACT STABILITY Regulation 5.2 1 For the purpose of this regulation, a sister ship means a cargo ship built by th e same shipyard from the same plans. 2 For any new sister ship with known differences from the lead sister ship that do not exceed the lightship displacement and longitudinal centre of gravity deviation limits specified in regulation 5.2, a detailed weig hts and centres of gravity calculation to adjust the lead sister ship's lightship properties should be carried out. These adjusted lead sister ship lightship properties are then used for comparison to the new sister ship's lightweight survey results. Howev er, in cases when the known differences from the lead sister ship exceed lightship displacement or longitudinal centre of gravity deviation limits specified in regulation 5.2, the ship should be inclined. 3 When the lightweight survey results do not exce ed the specified deviation limits, the lightship displacement and the longitudinal and transverse centres of gravity obtained from the lightweight survey should be used in conjunction with the higher of either the lead sister ship's vertical centre of grav ity or the calculated, adjusted value. 4 Regulation 5.2 may be applied to the SPS Code ships certified to carry less than 240 persons. Regulation 5.4 1 When alterations are made to a ship in service that result in calculable differences in the lightship properties, a detailed weights and centres of gravity calculation to adjust the lightship properties should be carried out. If the adjusted lightship disp lacement or longitudinal centre of gravity, when compared to the approved values, exceeds one of the deviation limits specified in regulation 5.5, the ship should be re - inclined. In addition, if the adjusted lightship vertical centre of gravity, when compa red to the approved value, exceeds 1%, the ship should be re - inclined. The lightship transverse centre of gravity is not subject to a deviation limit.

MSC 102 / 24/Add.1 Annex 13 , page 10 MSC 102 - 24 - Add.1.docx 2 When a ship does not exceed the deviation limits specified in explanatory note 1 above, amended stabil ity information should be provided to the master using the new calculated lightship properties if any of the following deviations from the approved values are exceeded: .1 1% of the lightship displacement; or .2 0.5% of L for the longitudinal centre of gravity; or .3 0.5% of the vertical centre of gravity. 2.1 However, in cases when these deviation limits are not exceeded, it is not necessary to amend the stability information supplied to the master. 3 When multiple alterations are made to a ship in service over a period of time and each alteration is within the deviation limits specified above, the cumulative total changes to the lightship properties from the most recent inclining also should not exceed the deviation limits specified above or the ship should be re - inclined. Regulation 5.5 When the lightwe ight survey results do not exceed the specified deviation limits, the lightship displacement and the longitudinal and transverse centres of gravity obtained from the lightweight survey should be used in conjunction with the vertical centre of gravity deriv ed from the most recent inclining in all subsequent stability information supplied to the master. REGULATION 5 - 1 – STABILITY INFORMATION TO BE SUPPLIED TO THE MASTER Regulation 5 - 1.3 The requirement that applied trim values shall coincide in all st ability information intended for use on board is intended to address initial stability calculations as well as those that may be necessary during the service life of the ship. Regulation 5 - 1.4 (see also regulation 7.2) 1 Linear interpolation of the limiting values between the draughts d s , d p and d l is only applicable to minimum GM values. If it is intended to develop curves of maximum permissible KG , a sufficient number of KM T values for intermediate draughts should be cal culated to ensure that the resulting maximum KG curves correspond with a linear variation of GM . When light service draught is not with the same trim as other draughts, KM T for draughts between partial and light service draught should be calculated for tri ms interpolated between trim at partial draught and trim at light service draught. 2 In cases where the operational trim range is intended to exceed ±0.5% of L , the original GM limit line should be designed in the usual manner with the deepest subdivisio n draught and partial subdivision draught calculated at level trim and estimated service trim used for the light service draught. Then additional sets of GM limit lines should be constructed on the basis of the operational range of trims which is covered b y loading conditions for each of the three draughts d s , d p and d l ensuring that intervals of 1% L are not exceeded. The sets of GM limit lines are combined to give a single envelope limiting GM curve. The effective trim range of the curve should be clearly stated.

Calculations covering different trim values should be carried ou t in steps not exceeding 1% of L . The whole range including intermediate trims should be covered by the damage stability calculations. Refer to the example showing an envelope curve obtained from calculations of 0 trim and 1% of L . 4 Temporary loading conditions may occur with a draught less than the light service draught d l due to ballast water exchange requirements, etc. In these cases, for draughts below d l , the GM limit value at d l is to be used. 5 Ships may be permitted to sail at draughts above the deepest subdivision draught d s according to the International Convention on Load Lines, e.g. using the tropical freeboard. In these cases, for draughts above d s the GM limit value at d s is to be used. Regulation 5 - 1.5 There could be cases where it is desirable to expand the trim range, for instance around d p . This approach is based on the principle that it is not necessary that the same number of trims be used when the GM is the same throughout a draught and when the steps between trims do not exce ed 1% of L . In these cases there will be three A values based on draughts s 1 , p 1 , l 1 and s 2 , p 2 , l 2 and s 2 , p 3 , l 2 .

REGULATION 7 – ATTAINED SUBDIVISION INDEX A Regulation 7.1 1 The probability of surviving after collision damage to the ship's hull is expressed by the index A . Producing an index A requires calculation of various damage scenarios defined by the extent of damage and the initial loading conditions of the ship before damage. Three loading conditions should be considered and the result weighted as follows: l p s A A A A 2 . 0 4 . 0 4 . 0 + + = where the indices s , p and l represent the three loading conditions and the factor to be multiplied to the index indicates how the index A f rom each loading condition is weighted. 2 The method of calculating A for a loading condition is expressed by the formula: 2.1 The index c represents one of the three loading conditions, the index i represents each investigated damage or group of damages and t is the number of damages to be investigated to calculate A c for the particular loading condition. 2.2 To obtain a maximum index A f or a given subdivision, t has to be equal to T , the total number of damages. 3 In practice, the damage combinations to be considered are limited either by significantly reduced contributions to A (i.e. flooding of substantially larger volumes) or by exce eding the maximum possible damage length. 4 The index A is divided into partial factors as follows: p i The p factor is solely dependent on the geometry of the watertight arrangement of the ship. v i The v factor is dependent on the geometry of the watertight arrangement (decks) of the ship and the draught of the initial loading condition. It represents the pro bability that the spaces above the horizontal subdivision will not be flooded. s i The s factor is dependent on the calculated survivability of the ship after the considered damage for a specific initial condition.

MSC 102 / 24/Add.1 Annex 13 , page 13 MSC 102 - 24 - Add.1.docx 5 Three initial loading conditions sh ould be used for calculating each index A. The loading conditions are defined by their mean draught d, trim and GM ( or KG). The mean draught and trim are illustrated in the figure below. 6 The GM (or KG ) values for the three loading conditions could, as a first attempt, be taken from the intact stability GM (or KG ) limit curve. If the required index R is not obtained, the GM (or KG ) values may be increased (or reduced), implying that the intact loading c onditions from the intact stability book must now meet the GM (or KG ) limit curve from the damage stability calculations derived by linear interpolation between the three GM s. 7 For a series of new passenger or cargo ships built from the same plans each of which have the same draughts d s , d p and d l as well as the same GM and trim limits, the attained subdivision index A calculated for the lead ship may be used for the other ships. In addition, small differences in the draught d l (and the subsequent change in the draught d p ) are acceptable if they are due to small differences in the lightship characteristics that do not exceed the deviation limits specified in regulation 5.2. For cases where these conditions are not met, a new attained subdivision index A s hould be calculated. "Built from the same plans" means that the watertight and weathertight aspects of the hull, bulkheads, openings and other parts of a ship that impact the attained subdivision index A calculation remain exactly the same. 8 For a passenger or cargo ship in service which undergoes alterations that materially affect the stability information supplied to the master and require it to be re - inclined in accordance with regulation 5.4, a new attained subdivision index A should be ca lculated. However, for alteration cases where a re - inclining is not required and the alterations do not change the watertight and weathertight arrangements of the ship that impact the attained subdivision index A , if d s and the GM and trim limits remain the same then a new attained subdivision index A is not required. 9 For passenger ships subject to lightweight surveys every 5 years, if the lightweight survey results are within the limits specified in regulation 5.5, and d s and the GM and trim limits remain the same, a new attained subdivision index A is not required. However, if the lightweight survey results exceed either limit specified in regulation 5.5, a new attained subdivision index A should be calculated. 10 For any ne w passenger or cargo ship for which the deviation in lightship characteristics between the preliminary and the as built values are within the limits specified in regulation 5.2 and d s is unchanged, then the preliminary attained subdivision index A calculat ion may be approved as the final attained subdivision index A calculation. However, for cases where these conditions are not met, then a new attained subdivision index A should be calculated.

MSC 102 / 24/Add.1 Annex 13 , page 14 MSC 102 - 24 - Add.1.docx Regulation 7.5 1 With the same intent as wing tanks, the summation of the attained index A should reflect effects caused by all watertight bulkheads and flooding boundaries within the damaged zone. It is not correct to assume damage only to one half of the ship's breadth B and ignore changes in subdivision that would reflect lesser contributions. 2 In the forward and aft e nds of the ship where the sectional breadth is less than the ship's breadth B , transverse damage penetration can extend beyond the centreline bulkhead. This application of the transverse extent of damage is consistent with the methodology to account for th e localized statistics which are normalized on the greatest moulded breadth B rather than the local breadth. 3 Where, at the extreme ends of the ship, the subdivision exceeds the waterline at the deepest subdivision draught, the damage penetration b or B /2 is to be taken from centreline. The figure below illustrates the shape of the B /2 line. 4 Where longitudinal corrugated bulkheads are fitted in wing compartments or on the centreline, they may be treated as equivalent plane bulkheads provided the corrugation depth is of the same order as the stiffening structure. The same principle may also be applied to transverse corrugated bulkheads.

The same applies for small recesses, drain wells, etc. 2 For ships up to L = 150 m the provision for allowing "minor progressive flooding" should be limited to pipes penetrating a watertight subdivision with a total cr oss - sectional area of not more than 710 mm 2 between any two watertight compartments. For ships of L = 150 m and upwards the total cross - sectional area of pipes should not exceed the cross - sectional area of one pipe with a diameter of L /5000 m.

The figures below illustrate the difference.

The coefficient b 12 is dependent on whether L s is greater or less than L * (i.e. 260 m); the other coefficients are valid irrespective of L s . 1. Longitudinal subdivision 2 In order to prepare for the calculation of index A , the ship's subdivision length L s is divided into a fixed discrete number of damage zones. These damage zones will determine the damage stability invest igation in the way of specific damages to be calculated. 3 There are no specific rules for longitudinally subdividing the ship, except that the length L s defines the extremities of the zones. Zone boundaries need not coincide with physical watertight bo undaries. However, it is important to consider a strategy carefully to obtain a good result (that is a large attained index A ). All zones and combination of adjacent zones may contribute to the index A . In general it is expected that the more zone boundari es the ship is divided into the higher the attained index will be , but this benefit should be balanced against extra computing time. The figure below shows different longitudinal zone divisions of the length L s . 4 The first example is a very rough division into three zones of approximately the same size with limits where longitudinal subdivision is established. The probability that the ship will survive a damage in one of the three zones is expected to be low (i.e. the s - factor is low or zero) and, therefore, the total attained index A will be correspondingly low. 5 In the second example the zones have been placed in accordance with the watertight arrangement, including minor subdivision (as in double bottom, etc. ). In this case there is a much better chance of obtaining higher s - factors. 6 Where transverse corrugated bulkheads are fitted, they may be treated as equivalent plane bulkheads, provided the corrugation depth is of the same order as the stiffening str ucture. 7 Pipes and valves directly adjacent or situated as close as practicable to a transverse bulkhead can be considered to be part of the bulkhead, provided the separation distance on either side of the bulkhead is of the same order as the bulkhead stiffening structure. The same applies for small recesses, drain wells, etc. RESOLUTION MSC.429(98)/REV.1 (adopted on 11 November 2020) REVISED EXPLANATORY NOTES TO THE SOLAS CHAPTER II-1 SUBDIVISION AND DAMAGE STABILITY REGULATIONS L\ 1--------+- I ----.-------+----------+------d 5 2 1 Z2 23 ◄ --1>!<11---1 , ◄ - - ◄ -- O S ◄ _ ____ .,.,.... _.,._, ,... __ _ z, ' Z2 ' Z3 Z◄ ZS ' Z6 za Z9 ' ZIO Z 11

The triangles at the bottom line indicate single zone damages and the parallelograms indicate adjacent zones damage s. 10 As an example, the triangle illustrates a damage opening the rooms in zone 2 to the sea and the parallelogram illustrates a damage where rooms in zones 4, 5 and 6 are flooded simultaneously. 11 The shaded area illustrates the effect of the ma ximum absolute damage length.

To describe the probability of penetrating only a wing compartment, a probability factor r is used, based mainly on the penetration depth b . The value of r is equal to 1, if the penetration depth is B/2 where B is the maximum breadth of the ship at the deepest subdivision draught d s , and r = 0 if b = 0. 2 The penetration depth b is measured at level deepest subdivision draught d s as a transverse distance from the ship side right - angled to the centreline to a longitudinal barrier. 3 Where the actual watertight bulkhead is not a plane parallel to the shell, b should be determine d by means of an assumed line, dividing the zone to the shell in a relationship b 1 / b 2 with 1/2 ≤ b 1 /b 2 ≤ 2 . 4 Examples of such assumed division lines are illustrated in the figure below.

There are three initial conditions corresponding to the three draughts d s , d p and d l . 2 Immersion limits – immersion limits are an array of points that are not to be immersed at various stages of flooding as indicated in regulations 7 - 2.5.2 and 7 - 2.5. 3. 3 Openings – all openings need to be defined: both weathertight and unprotected. Openings are the most critical factor to preventing an inaccurate index A . If the final waterline immerses the lower edge of any opening through which progressive floodi ng takes place, the factor " s " may be recalculated taking such flooding into account. However, in this case the s value should also be calculated without taking into account progressive flooding and corresponding opening. The smallest s value should be ret ained for the contribution to the attained index. Regulation 7 - 2.1 1 In cases where the GZ curve may include more than one "range" of positive righting levers for a specific stage of flooding, only one continuous positive "range" of the GZ curve may be used within the allowable range/heel limits for calculation purposes. Different stages of flo oding may not be combined in a single GZ curve.

In figure 2, only one s - factor can be calcul ated. Regulation 7 - 2.2 Intermediate stages of flooding 1 The case of instantaneous flooding in unrestricted spaces in way of the damage zone does not require intermediate stage flooding calculations. Where intermediate stages of flooding calculations are necessary in connection with progressive flooding, flooding through non - watertight boundaries or cross - flooding, they should reflect the sequence of filling as well as filling level phases. Calculations for intermediate stages of flooding should be pe rformed whenever equalization is not instantaneous, i.e. equalization is of a duration greater than 60 s. Such calculations consider the progress through one or more floodable (non - watertight) spaces, or cross - flooded spaces. Bulkheads surrounding refriger ated spaces, incinerator rooms and longitudinal bulkheads fitted with non - watertight doors are typical examples of structures that may significantly slow down the equalization of main compartments. Flooding boundaries 2 If a compartment contains decks, inner bulkheads, structural elements and doors of sufficient tightness and strength to seriously restrict the flow of water, for intermediate stage flooding calculation purposes it should be divided into corresponding non - watertight spaces. It is assumed that the non - watertight divisions considered in the calculations are limited to "A" class fire - rated bulkheads and decks, and do not apply to "B" class fire - rated bulkheads normally used in accommodation areas (e.g. cabins and corridors). This guidance als o relates to regulation 4.5. For spaces in the double bottom, in general, only main longitudinal structures with a limited number of openings have to be considered as flooding boundaries.

MSC 102 / 24/Add.1 Annex 13 , page 26 MSC 102 - 24 - Add.1.docx Sequential flooding computation 3 For each damage scenario, the damage extent and location determine the initial stage of flooding. Calculations should be performed in stages, each stage comprising at least two intermediate filling phases in addition to th e full phase per flooded space. Unrestricted spaces in way of damage should be considered as flooded immediately. Every subsequent stage involves all connected spaces being flooded simultaneously until an impermeable boundary or final equilibrium is reache d. Unless the flooding process is simulated using time - domain methods, when a flooding stage leads to both a self - acting cross - flooding device and a non - watertight boundary, the self - acting cross - flooding device is assumed to act immediately and occur befo re the non - watertight boundary is breached. If due to the configuration of the subdivision in the ship it is expected that other intermediate stages of flooding are more onerous, then those should be investigated. 3.1 For each phase of a flooding stage ( except the final full phase), the instantaneous transverse moment of this floodwater is calculated by assuming a constant volume of water at each heeling angle. The GZ curve is calculated with a constant intact displacement at all stages of flooding. Only one free surface needs to be assumed for water in spaces flooded during the current stage. 3.2 In the final full phase of each stage, the water level in rooms flooded during this stage reaches the outside sea level, so the lost buoyancy method can be use d. The same method applies for every successive stage (added volume of water with a constant intact displacement for all phases before the final full phase of the stage in consideration), while each of the previous stages at the final full phase can be cal culated with the lost buoyancy method. 3.3 The examples below present a simplified, sequential approach to intermediate stage down - flooding and cross - flooding. Because simultaneous down - flooding and cross - flooding is not accounted for, any time - to - flood calculated with this sequential approach should be conservative. Alternative approaches, such as time - domain flooding simulation, are also acceptable. Example 1: Major damage with cross - flooding device Stage 0: Unrestricted spaces in way of damage shou ld be considered as flooded immediately (intermediate phases are not considered). The lost buoyancy method is applied as this is a full (final) phase. Provided the ship does not capsize and remains at a floating position from which cross - flooding can proce ed, stage 0 need not be taken into account for the s factor calculation as the first intermediate stage to be calculated is after 60 s.

If complete fluid equalization occurs in 60 s or less, it should be treated as instantaneous and no further calculations need to be carried out. Additionally, in cases where s final = 1 is achieved in 60 s or less, but equalization is not complete, instantaneous flooding may also be assumed if s final will not become reduced. In any cases where complete fluid equalization exceeds 60 s , the value of s intermediate after 60 s is the first intermediate stage to be considered. Only self - acting open cross - flooding arrangements without valves should be considered effective for instantaneous flooding cases. 6 Provided that the ship has a GZ greater than 0 and remains in a position from which cross - flooding can proceed, stage 0 need not be taken into account for the s factor calculation as the first intermediate stage to be calculated is after 60 s.

MSC 102 / 24/Add.1 Annex 13 , page 30 MSC 102 - 24 - Add.1.docx 7 Only cross - flooding devices which are suf ficiently submerged below the external waterline at stage 0 are to be used in the calculation for cross - flooding according to resolution MSC.362(92). 8 If complete fluid equalization can be finalized in 10 min or less, the assessment of survivability is carried out using the formula in regulation 7 - 2.1.1 (i.e. as the smallest value of s intermediate or s final · s mom ) 9 In case the equalization time is longer than 10 min, s final is calculated for the floating position achieved after 10 min of equalization. This floating position is computed by calculating the amount of flood water according to resolution MSC.362(92) using interpolation, where the equalization time is set to 10 min, i.e. the interpolation of the flood water volume is made between the case before equalization ( T =0) and the total calculated equalization time. For damage cases involving different cross - floodin g devices serving different spaces, when the interpolation between the case before equalization ( T=0 ) and the total calculated equalization time is needed for flood water volume calculation after 60 s or 10 min, the total equalization time is to be calcula ted separately for each cross - flooding device. 10 In any cases where complete fluid equalization exceeds 10 min, the value of s final used in the formula in regulation 7 - 2.1.1 should be the minimum of s final at 10 min or at final equalization. 11 The fa ctor s intermediate,i may be used for cross - flooding stages if they are intermediate stages which are followed by other subsequent flooding stages (e.g. the flooding stages of non - watertight compartments). Alternatives 12 As an alternative to the proced ure described above in the explanatory notes for regulation 7 - 2.2, direct calculation using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), time - domain flooding simulations or model testing may be used to analyse intermediate stages of flooding and determine the time for equalization. Regulation 7 - 2.3 1 The formulation of s final,i is based on target values for GZ and Range to achieve s = 1. These values are defined as TGZ max and TRange . 2 If ro - ro spaces are damaged there might be the possibility of water accumul ation on these deck spaces. To account for this, in any damage case where the ro - ro space is damaged the higher values for TGZ max and TRange are to be applied for the calculation of s i . Regulation 7 - 2.4.1.2 The parameter A (projected lateral area) used in this paragraph does not refer to the attained subdivision index. Regulation 7 - 2.5.2.1 Unprotected openings 1 The flooding angle will be limited by immersion of such an opening. It is not necessary to define a criterion for non - immersion of unprotected openings at equilibrium, because if it is immersed, the range of positive GZ limited to flooding angle will be ze ro so " s " will be equal to zero.

An unprotected opening will not be taken into account if the two connected rooms are flooded or none of these rooms are flooded. If the opening is con nected to the outside, it will not be taken into account if the connected compartment is flooded. An unprotected opening does not need to be taken into account if it connects a flooded room or the outside to an undamaged room, if this room will be consider ed as flooded in a subsequent stage. Openings fitted with a weathertight mean s of closing ("weathertight openings") 3 The survival " s " factor will be "0" if any such point is submerged at a stage which is considered as "final". Such points may be sub merged during a stage or phase which is considered as "intermediate", or within the range beyond equilibrium. 4 If an opening fitted with a weathertight means of closure is submerged at equilibrium during a stage considered as intermediate, it should be demonstrated that this weathertight means of closure can sustain the corresponding head of water and that the leakage rate is negligible. 5 These points are also defined as connecting two rooms or one room and the outside, and the same principle as for unprotected openings is applied to take them into account or not. If several stages have to be considered as "final", a "weathertight opening" does not need to be taken into account if it connects a flooded room or the outside to an undamaged room if this room will be considered as flooded in a successive "final" stage. Regulation 7 - 2.5.2.2 1 Partial immersion of the bulkhead deck may be accepted at final equilibrium. This provision is intended to ensure that evacuation along the bulkhead deck to the vertical escapes will not be impeded by water on that deck. A "horizontal evacuation route" in the context of this regulation means a route on the bulkhead deck connecting spaces located on and under this deck with the vertical escapes from the bulkhea d deck required for compliance with SOLAS chapter II - 2. 2 Horizontal evacuation routes on the bulkhead deck include only escape routes (designated as category 2 stairway spaces according to SOLAS regulation II - 2/9.2.2.3 or as category 4 stairway spaces a ccording to SOLAS regulation II - 2/9.2.2.4 for passenger ships carrying not more than 36 passengers) used for the evacuation of undamaged spaces. Horizontal evacuation routes do not include corridors (designated as category 3 corridor spaces according to SO LAS regulation II - 2/9.2.2.3 or as category 2 corridor spaces according to SOLAS regulation II - 2/9.2.2.4 for passenger ships carrying not more than 36 passengers) or escape routes within a damaged zone. No part of a horizontal evacuation route serving undam aged spaces should be immersed. 3 s i = 0 where it is not possible to access a stair leading up to the embarkation deck from an undamaged space as a result of flooding to the "stairway" or "horizontal stairway" on the bulkhead deck. Regulation 7 - 2.5.3.1 1 The purpose of this paragraph is to provide an incentive to ensure that evacuation through a vertical escape will not be obstructed by water from above. The paragraph is intended for smaller emergency escapes, typically hatches, where fitting of a wat ertight or weathertight means of closure would otherwise exclude them from being considered as flooding points.

MSC 102 / 24/Add.1 Annex 13 , page 32 MSC 102 - 24 - Add.1.docx 2 Since the probabilistic regulations do not require that the watertight bulkheads be carried continuously up to the bulkhead deck, care should be taken to ensure that evacuation from intact spaces through flooded spaces below the bulkhead deck will remain possible, for instance by means of a watertight trunk. Regulation 7 - 2.6 The sketches in the figure illustrate the connection between position of watertight decks in the reserve buoyancy area and the use of factor v for damages below these decks. Above the waterline Below the waterline In this example, there are 3 horizontal subdivisions to be taken into account as the vertical extent of damage. The example shows the maximum possible vertical extent of damage d + 12.5 m is positioned between H 2 and H 3 . H 1 with factor v 1 , H 2 with facto r v 2 > v 1 but v 2 < 1 and H 3 with factor v 3 = 1. The factors v 1 and v 2 are the same as above. The reserve buoyancy above H 3 should be taken undamaged in all damage cases. The combination of damages into the rooms R1, R2 and R3 positioned b elow the initial water line should be chosen so that the damage with the lowest s - factor is taken into account. That often results in the definition of alternative damages to be calculated and compared. If the deck taken as lower limit of damage is not wat ertight, down flooding should be considered. 1 R R 2 R 3 Dam.

This should only be considered in cases whe re it is evident that there is a major discrepancy between the values shown in the regulation and the real values. It is not designed for improving the attained value of a deficient ship of regular type by the modification of chosen spaces in the ship that are known to provide significantly onerous results.

MSC 102 / 24/Add.1 Annex 13 , page 34 MSC 102 - 24 - Add.1.docx 2 The purpose of the paragraph is to prevent any flooding of limited extent from immobilizing the ship. This principle should be applied regardless of how the flooding might occur. Only flooding below the bulkhead de ck need be considered. REGULATION 9 – DOUBLE BOTTOMS IN PASSENGER SHIPS AND CARGO SHIPS OTHER THAN TANKERS Regulation 9.1 1 This regulation is intended to minimize the impact of flooding from a minor grounding. Special attention should be paid to the vulnerable area at the turn of the bilge. When justifying a deviation from fitting an inner bottom an assessment of the consequen ces of allowing a more extensive flooding than reflected in the regulation should be provided. 2 The determination regarding the requirement to fit a double bottom "as far as this is practicable and compatible with the design and proper working of the sh ip" is made, or should be accepted by, the Administration or a recognized organization acting on its behalf. 3 Compliance with the damage stability requirement in regulation 9.8 should not be considered as an equivalent optional requirement to the fittin g of a dimensionally compliant double bottom. This is because a flooded watertight compartment, such as an engine - room, that complies with the damage stability requirement in regulation 9.8 is not equivalent to a flooded double bottom below that compartmen t. Compliance with the damage stability requirement in regulation 9.8 is intended to provide a minimum level of safety in cases when the fitting of a double bottom is not practicable or compatible with the design and proper working of the ship. Regulati on 9.2 1 Except as provided in regulations 9.3 and 9.4, parts of the double bottom not extended for the full width of the ship as required by regulation 9.2 should be considered an unusual arrangement for the purpose of this regulation and should be han dled in accordance with regulation 9.7. An example is provided below. 2 If an inner bottom is located higher than the partial subdivision draught d p , this should be considered an unusual arrangement and is to be handled in accordance with regulation 9.7. Regulations 9.3.2.2, 9.6 and 9.7 For cargo ships of less than 80 m in length ( L ), the alternative arrangements to provide a level of safety satis factory to the Administration should be limited to compartments not having a double bottom, having an unusual bottom arrangement, or having an "other well" extending below the required double bottom height that is greater than the h /2 or 500 mm limit indic ated in regulation 9.3.2.1.

Regulation 9.6 1 Any part of a passenger ship or a cargo ship of 80 m in length ( L ) and upwards where a double bottom is omitted in accordance with regulation 9.1, 9.4 or 9.5 shall be capable of withstanding bottom damages, as specified in regulation 9.8. The intent of this provision is to specify the circumstances under which the Administration should require calculations, which damage extents to assume and wha t survival criteria to apply when double bottoms are not fitted. 2 The definition of "watertight" in regulation 2.17 implies that the strength of inner bottoms and other boundaries assumed to be watertight should be verified if they are to be considered effective in this context. Regulation 9.7 The reference to a "p lane" in regulation 9.2 does not imply that the surface of the inner bottom may not be stepped in the vertical direction. Minor steps and recesses need not be considered unusual arrangements for the purpose of this paragraph as long as no part of the inner bottom is located below the reference plane. Discontinuities in way of wing tanks are covered by regulation 9.4. Regulation 9.8 1 For ships to which the probabilistic damage stability requirements of part B - 1 apply, the term "all service conditions " used in this paragraph means the three loading conditions with all trims used to calculate the attained subdivision index A . For ships not subject to the probabilistic damage stability requirements in part B - 1, such as cargo ships that comply with the su bdivision and damage stability requirements of other instruments as allowed by regulation II - 1/4.2.1.2 and cargo ships of less than 80 m in length ( L ), "all service conditions" means that the limit curves or tables required by regulation 5 - 1.2.1 should inc lude values calculated for the same draught and trim range(s) as for the other applicable stability requirements. 2 The damage extents specified in this paragraph should be applied to all parts of the ship where no double bottom is fitted, as permitted by regulations 9.1, 9.4 or 9.5, and include any adjacent spaces located within the extent of damage. Small wells in accordance with regulation 9.3.1 do not need to be considered damaged even if within the extent of the damage.

A s an alternative to fitting an isolation or non - return valve, pipes may be routed above the damaged waterline in such a way that progressive flooding is prevented, taking into account the dynamic movements of the ship in a damaged condition. 1.2 However , progressive flooding may be taken into account in accordance with SOLAS regulation 7 - 2.5.4 instead. 2 For the purpose of this explanatory note the following definitions apply: A closed piping system is a piping system without openings in multiple wat ertight compartments.

Ample time may be given to prepare for the pressure test, i.e. dismantling the fire testing equ ipment and rigging the pressure test equipment. 5.1 The pressure test should be carried out with the pipe section used in the fire test still in place. 5.2 Any pipe insulation fitted for the purpose of the fire test may be removed before the pressure t est. 5.3 Prototype testing need not be carried out if the pipe penetration is made of steel or equivalent material having a thickness of 3 mm or greater and a length of not less than 900 mm (preferably 450 mm on each side of the division), and there are no openings.

MSC 102 / 24/Add.1 Annex 13 , page 45 MSC 102 - 24 - Add.1.docx APPENDIX GUIDELINES FOR THE PREPARATION OF SUBDIVISION AND DAMAGE STABILITY CALCULATIONS GENERAL 1.1 Purpose o f the Guidelines 1.1.1 These Guidelines serve the purpose of simplifying the process of the damage stability analysis, as experience has shown that a systematic and complete presentation of the particulars results in considerable saving of time during th e approval process. 1.1.2 A damage stability analysis serves the purpose of provid ing proof of the damage stability standard required for the respective ship type. At present, two different calculation methods, the deterministic concept and the probabil istic concept are applied. 1.2 Scope of analysis and documentation on board 1.2.1 The scope of subdivision and damage stability analysis is determined by the required damage stability standard and aims at providing the ship's master with clear intact stability requirements. In general, this is achieved by determining KG - respective GM - li mit curves, containing the admissible stability values for the draught range to be covered. 1.2.2 Within the scope of the analysis thus defined, all potential or necessary damage conditions will be determined, taking into account the damage stability cr iteria, in order to obtain the required damage stability standard. Depending on the type and size of ship, this may involve a considerable amount of analyses. 1.2.3 Referring to SOLAS chapter II - 1, regulation 19, the necessity to provide the crew with th e relevant information regarding the subdivision of the ship is expressed, therefore plans should be provided and permanently exhibited for the guidance of the officer in charge. These plans should clearly show for each deck and hold the boundaries of the watertight compartments, the openings therein with means of closure and position of any controls thereof, and the arrangements for the correction of any list due to flooding. In addition, Damage Control Booklets containing the aforementioned information sh ould be available. DOCUMENTS FOR SUBMISSION 2.1 Presentation of documents The documentation should begin with the following details: principal dimensions, ship type, designation of intact conditions, designation of damage conditions and pertinent damaged compartments, KG - respective GM - limit curve.
