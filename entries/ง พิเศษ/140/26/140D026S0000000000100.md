29 IMDG Code (incorporating Amendment 40-20) 1 Chapter 1.3 Training 1.3.0 Introductory note The successful application of regulations concerning the transport of dangerous goods and the achievement of their objectives are greatly dependent on the appreciation by all persons concerned of the risks involved and on a detailed understanding of the regulations . This can only be achieved by properly plann ed and maintained initial and retraining programmes for all persons concerned with the transport of dangerous goods . The provisions of paragraphs 1 . 3 . 1 . 4 to 1 . 3 . 1 . 7 remain recommendatory (see 1 . 1 . 1 . 5) . 1.3.1 Training of shore-side personnel 1.3.1.1 Shore-based personnel * engaged in the transport of dangerous goods intended to be transported by sea shall be trained in the contents of dangerous goods provisions commensurate with their responsibilities . Employees shall be trained in accordanc e with the provisions of 1 . 3 . 1 before assuming responsibilities and s hall only perform functions, for which required training has not yet been provided, under the direct supervision of a trained person . Training requirements specific to sec urity of dangerous goods in chapter 1 . 4 shall also be addressed .

1 38 IMDG Code (incorporating Amendment 40-20) 1 Chapter 1.5 General provisions concerning radioactive material 1.5.1 Scope and application 1.5.1.1 The provisions of this Code establish stan dards of safety which provide an acceptable level of control of the radiation, criticality and thermal hazards to people, property and the environment that are associated with the transport of radioactive material . These provisions are based on the IAEA Reg ulations for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Material, 2018 Edition, IAEA Safety Standards Series No. SSR–6 (Rev.1), IAEA, Vienna (2018) . Explanatory material can be found in Adv isory Material for the IAEA Regulations for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Material (2018 Edition), Safety Standard Series No. SSG-26 (Rev.1), IAEA, Vienna (2019) . 1.5.1.2 The objective of this Code is to establis h provisions that shall be satisfied to ensure safety and to protect people, property and the environment from harmful effects of ionizing radiation during the transport of radioactive material . This protection is achieved by requiri ng: .1 containment of the radioactive contents; . 2 control of external dose rate ; .3 prevention of criticality; and .4 prevention of damage caused by heat . These provisions are satisfied firstly by ap plying a graded approach to contents limits for packages and conveyances and to performance standards applied to package designs depending upon the hazard of the radioactive contents . Secondly, they are satisfied by imposing c onditions on the design and operation of packages and on the maintenance of packagings, including a consideration of the nature of the radioactive contents . Thirdly, they are satisfied by requiring ad ministrative controls including, where appropriate, approval by competent authorities . Finally, further protection is provid ed by making arrangements for planning and preparing emergency response to protect people, property and the environment . 1.5.1.3 The provisions of this Code apply to the trans port of radioactive material by sea, including transport which is incidental to the use of the radioactive material . Transport comprises all operations an d conditions associated with and involved in the movement of radioactive material; these include the design, manufacture, maintenance and repair of packaging, and the preparation, consigning, loading, transport including in-transit storage, unloading and receipt at the final destination of loads of radioactive material and packages . A graded approach is applied to the performa nce standards in the provisions of this Code that are characterized by three general severity levels: .1 routine conditions of transport (inciden t-free); .2 normal conditions of transport (minor m ishaps); and .3 accident conditions of transport . 1.5.1.4 The provisions of this Code do not apply to any of t he following: .1 radioactive material that is an integral p art of the means of transport; .2 radioactive material moved within an est ablishment which is subject to appropriate safety regulations in force in the establishment and where the movement does not involve public roads or railways; .3 radioactive material implanted or inco rporated into a person or live animal for diagnosis or treatment; .4 radioactive material in or on a person who is to b e transported for medical treatment because the person has been subject to accidental or deliberate intake of radioactive material or to contamination; .5 radioactive material in consumer produc ts which have received regulatory approval, following their sale to the end user; .6 natural material and ores containing nat urally occurring radionuclides (which may have been processed), provided the activity concentration of the material does not exceed 10 times the values specified in table 2 . 7 . 2 . 2 . 1, or calculated in accordance with 2 . 7 . 2 . 2 . 2 . 1 and 2 . 7 . 2 . 2 . 3 to 2 . 7 . 2 . 2 . 6 .

Part 6 – Construction and testing of packagings, IBCs, etc. 308 IMDG Code (incorporating Amendment 40-20) 6 6.1.3 Marking Note 1: The marks indicate that the packaging which bears them correspond to a successfully tested design type and that it complies with the provisions of this chapter which are related to the manufacture, but not to the use, of the packaging . In itself, therefore, the marks do not nece ssarily confirm that the packaging may be used for any substance . The type of packaging (such as steel drum), i ts maximum capacity or mass, and any special provisions are specified for each substance or article in part 3 of this Code . Note 2: The marks are intended to be of assista nce to packaging manufacturers, reconditioners, packaging users, carriers and regulatory authorities . In relation to the use of a new pack aging, the original marks are a means for its manufacturer to identify the type and to indicate those performance test provisions that have been met . Note 3 : The marks do not always provid e full details of the test levels, etc . , and these may need to be taken furthe r into account, such as by reference to a test certificate, test reports or register of successfully tested packagings . For example, a packaging having an X or Y mark ma y be used for substances to which a packing group having a lesser degree of danger has been assigned, with the relevant maximum permissible value of the relative density * determined by taking into account the factor 1 . 5 or 2 . 25 indicated in the packaging test provis ions in 6 . 1 . 5 as appropriate, i . e . packing group I packaging tested f or products of relative density 1 . 2 could be used as a packing group II packaging fo r products of relative density 1 . 8 or packing group III packaging of relative d ensity 2 . 7, provided, of course, that all the performa nce criteria can still be met with the product having the higher relative density . 6.1.3.1 Each packaging intended for use accordin g to this Code shall bear marks which are durable, legible and placed in such a location and of such a size relative to the packaging as to be readily visible . For packages with a gross mass of more than 30 kg , the marks or a duplicate thereof shall appear on the top or on a side of the packaging . Letters, numerals and symbols shall be at l east 12 mm high, except for packagings of 30 L capacity or less or of 30 kg maximum net mass, when they shall be at least 6 mm in height and except for packagings of 5 L capacity or less or of 5 kg maximum net mass when they shall be of an appropriate size . The marks shall show: (a) The United Nations packaging symbol: This symbol shall not be used for any purpose other than certifying that a packaging, a flexible bulk container, a portable tank or a MEGC complies with the relevant requirements in chapters 6 . 1, 6 . 2, 6 . 3, 6 . 5, 6 . 6, 6 . 7 or 6 . 9 . For embossed metal packagings the capit al letters “UN” may be applied as the symbol . (b) The code designating the type of packaging according to 6 . 1 . 2 . (c) A code in two parts: (i) a letter designating the packing group or gr oups for which the design type has been successfully tested: “X” for packing groups I, II and III “Y” for packing groups II and III “Z” for packing group III only; (ii) the relative density, rounded off to the firs t decimal, for which the design type has been tested for packagings, without inner packagings, intended to contain liquids; this may be omitted when the relative density does not exceed 1 . 2 . For packagings intended to contain solids or inner packagings, the maximum gross mass in kilograms . (d) Either a letter “S”, denoting that the packag ing is intended for the transport of solids or inner packagings, or, for packagings (other than combination packagings) intended to contain liquids, the hydraulic test pressure which the packaging was shown to withstand in kilopascals, rounded down to the nearest 10 kPa . * Relative density ( d ) is considered to be synonymous with speci fic gravity (SG) and will be used throughout this text . △ Non-commercial use only MSC 102/24/Add.2 Annex 4, page 319

Where multilateral approval is effecte d by issue of certificates by successive countries, each certificate shall bear the appropriate identification mark and the package whose design was so approved shall bear all appropriate identification marks . For example: A/132/B(M)F CH/28/B(M)F would be the identification mark of a package wh ich was originally approved by Austria and was subsequently approved, by separate certificate, by Switzerland . Additional identification marks w ould be tabulated in a similar manner on the package; (c) the revision of a certificate shall be indicated by a parenthetical expression following the identification mark on the certificate .

455 IMDG Code (incorporating Amendment 40-20) 7 Chapter 7.1 General stowage provisions 7.1.1 Introduction This chapter contains the general provisions for the stowage of dangerous goods in all types of ships . Specific provisions applicable to, con tainer ships, ro-ro ships, general cargo ships and barge carrying ships, are stipulated in chapters 7 . 4 to 7 . 7 . 7.1.2 Definitions Note 1: The term “magazine” is no longer used in the context of the IMDG Code . A magazine that is not a fixed part of the ship shal l meet the provisions for a closed cargo transport unit for class 1 (see 7 . 1 . 2) . A magazine that is a fixed part of the sh ip such as compartment, below deck area or hold shall meet the provisions of 7 . 6 . 2 . 4 . Note 2: Cargo holds cannot be interpreted a s closed cargo transport units . Clear of living quarters means that packa ges or cargo transport units shall be stowed a minimum distance of 3 m from accommodation, air intakes, machinery spaces and other enclosed work areas . Closed cargo transport unit for class 1 mea ns a unit which fully encloses the contents by permanent structures, can be secured to the ship’s structure and is, except for division 1 . 4, structurally serviceable as defin ed in this section . Cargo transport units with fabric sides o r tops are not closed cargo transport units . The floor of any closed cargo transport unit s hall either be constructed of wood, close-boarded, or so arranged that goods are stowed on sparred gratings, wooden pallets or dunnage . Combustible material means material which m ay or may not be dangerous goods but which is easily ignited and supports combustion . Examples of combustible materials inc lude wood, paper, straw, vegetable fibres, products made from such materials, coal, lubricants, and oils . This definition does not apply to p ackaging material or dunnage . Potential sources of ignition means, bu t is not limited to, open fires, machinery exhausts, galley uptakes, electrical outlets and electrical equipment including those on refrigerated or heated cargo transport units unless they are of certified safe type . * Protected from sources of heat means that packages and cargo transport units shall be stowed at least 2 . 4 m from heated ship structures, where the su rface temperature is liable to exceed 55 ° C . Examples of heated structures are steam p ipes, heating coils, top or side walls of heated fuel and cargo tanks, and bulkheads of machinery spaces . In addition, packages not loaded inside a cargo tr ansport unit and stowed on deck shall be shaded from direct sunlight . The surface of a cargo transport unit can hea t rapidly when in direct sunlight in nearly windless conditions and the cargo may also become heated . Depending on the nature of the goods in the car go transport unit and the planned voyage precautions shall be taken to ensure that exposure to direct sunlight is reduced . Stowage means the proper placement of dange rous goods on board a ship in order to ensure safety and environmental protection during transport . Stowage on deck means stowage on the weather d eck . For open ro-ro cargo spaces see 7 . 5 . 2 . 6 . Stowage under deck means any stowage that is not on the weather deck . For hatchless containerships see 7 . 4 . 2 . 1 . Structurally serviceable for class 1 me ans the cargo transport unit shall not have major defects in its structural components, e . g . top and bottom rails, top and bottom end rail s, door sill and header, floor cross-members, corner posts, and corner fittings in a freight container . Major defects are: dents or bends in the stru ctural * For cargo spaces, refer to SOLAS II-2/19 . 3 . 2 and for refrigerated or heated cargo trans port units refer to Recommendations published by the International Electrotechnical Commission, in particular IEC 60079 .

7 464 IMDG Code (incorporating Amendment 40-20) Chapter 7.2 General segregation provisions 7.2.1 Introduction This chapter contains the general provisions for the segregation of goods which are mutually incompatible . Additional segregation provisions are give n in: 7 . 3 Consigning operations concerning the p acking and use of cargo transport units (CTUs) and related provisions; 7 . 4 Stowage and segregation on containerships ; 7 . 5 Stowage and segregation on roll-on/roll-off ships; 7 . 6 Stowage and segregation on general cargo shi ps; and 7 . 7 Shipborne barges on barge-carrying ships . 7.2.2 Definitions 7.2.2.1 Segregation Segregation is the process of separating two or more substances or articles which are considered mutually incompatible when their packing or stowage together may result in undue hazards in case of leakage or spillage, or any other accident . However, as the extent of the hazard arising m ay vary, the segregation arrangements required may also vary as appropriate . Segregation is obtained by maintainin g certain distances between incompatible dangerous goods or by requiring the presence of one or more steel bulkheads or decks between them, or a combination thereof . Intervening spaces between such dange rous goods may be filled with other cargo compatible with the dangerous substances or articles in question . 7.2.2.2 Segregation terms The following segregation terms that are used throughout this Code are defined in other chapters of this part as they apply to packing cargo transport units and segregation on board different ship types: .1 “away from”; .2 “separated from”; .3 “separated by a complete compartment or hol d from”; .4 “separated longitudinally by an inter vening complete compartment or hold from” . Segregation terms such as “away from class ... ” that are used in the Dangerous Goods List, “class ...” is deemed to include: .1 all substances within “class ...”; and .2 all substances for which a subsidiary haza rd label of “class ...” is required . 7.2.3 Segregation provisions 7.2.3.1 To determine the segregation requireme nts between two or more dangerous goods, the segregation provisions, including the segregation table (7 . 2 . 4) and column 16b of the Dangerous Goods List sh all be consulted, see also the annex to this chapter . In case of conflicting provisions, the pro visions of column 16b of the Dangerous Goods List, always take precedence . 7.2.3.2 Whenever a segregation term applies (see 7 . 2 . 2 . 2), the goods are: .1 not permitted to be packed in the same outer pac kaging; and .2 not permitted to be transported in the same ca rgo transport unit except as provided in 7 . 2 . 6 and 7 . 3 . 4 . For “limited quantities” and “excepte d quantities” see chapters 3 . 4 and 3 . 5 . Non-commercial use only MSC 102/24/Add.2 Annex 4, page 475

Chapter 7.2 – General segregation provisions 465 IMDG Code (incorporating Amendment 40-20) 7 7.2.3.3 Where the provisions of this Code indicate a s ingle secondary hazard (one subsidiary hazard label), the segregation provisions applicable to that hazard shall take precedence where they are more stringent than those of the primary hazard . The segregation provisions correspo nding to a subsidiary hazard of class 1 are those for class 1 division 1 . 3 . 7.2.3.4 The segregation provisions for substan ces, materials or articles having more than two hazards (two or more subsidiary hazard labels) are given in column 16b of the Dangerous Goods List . For example: In the Dangerous Goods List entry for BROMIN E CHLORIDE, class 2 . 3, UN 2901, subsidiary hazards 5 . 1 and 8, the following particular segrega tion is specified: “SG6 (segregation as for class 5 . 1), and SG19 (stow “separated from” class 7) . ” 7.2.4 Segregation table The general provisions for segregation between the various classes of dangerous goods are shown in the “segregation table” given below . Since the properties of substances, mate rials or articles within each class may vary greatly, the Dangerous Goods List shall always be consulted for particular provisions for segregation as, in the case of conflicting provisions, these take precedence over the general provisions . Segregation shall also take account of a sin gle subsidiary hazard label .

Part 7 – Provisions concerning transport operations 466 IMDG Code (incorporating Amendment 40-20) 7 7.2.5 Segregation groups 7.2.5.1 For the purpose of segregation, dangerou s goods having certain similar chemical properties have been grouped together in segregation groups as listed in 7 . 2 . 5 . 2 . The entries allocated to these segr egation groups are listed in 3 . 1 . 4 . 4 and are identified by a segregation group cod e in column 16b of the Dangerous Goods List . 7.2.5.2 The segregation group codes given in colum n 16b of the Dangerous Goods List are as specified below: Segregation Group Code Segregation Group Description SGG1 1 acids SGG1a 1, entries marked * * identifies strong acids SGG2 2 ammonium compounds SGG3 3 bromates SGG4 4 chlorates SGG5 5 chlorites SGG6 6 cyanides SGG7 7 heavy metals and their salts (including their organometallic compounds) SGG8 8 hypochlorites SGG9 9 lead and its compounds SGG10 10 liquid halogenated hydrocarbons SGG11 11 mercury and mercury compounds SGG12 12 nitrites and their mixtures SGG13 13 perchlorates SGG14 14 permanganates SGG15 15 powdered metals SGG16 16 peroxides SGG17 17 azides SGG18 18 alkalis 7.2.5.3 It is recognized that not all substances, mi xtures, solutions or preparations falling within a segregation group are listed in the IMDG Code by name . These are shipped under N . O . S . entries . Although these N . O . S . entries are not themselves listed in the se gregation groups (see 3 . 1 . 4 . 4), the consignor shall decide whether inc lusion under the segregation group is appropriate and, if so, shall mention that fact in the transport document (see 5 . 4 . 1 . 5 . 11) . 7.2.5.4 The segregation groups in this Code do not cover substances which fall outside the classification criteria of this Code . It is recognized that some non-hazardou s substances have similar chemical properties as substances listed in the segregation groups . A consignor or the person responsible for p acking the goods into a cargo transport unit who does have knowledge of the chemical properties of such non-dangerous goods may decide to implement the segregation requirements of a related segregation group on a voluntary basis . 7.2.6 Special segregation provisions and exempt ions 7.2.6.1 Notwithstanding 7 . 2 . 3 . 3 and 7 . 2 . 3 . 4, substances of the same class may be stowed to gether without regard to segregation required by secondary hazards (subsidiary hazard label(s)), provided that the substances do not react dangerously with each other and cause: .1 combustion and/or evolution of consider able heat; .2 evolution of flammable, toxic or asphyxia nt gases; .3 the formation of corrosive substances; or .4 the formation of unstable substances .

Chapter 7.2 – General segregation provisions 467 IMDG Code (incorporating Amendment 40-20) 7 7.2.6.2 Where the Dangerous Goods List specifies th at “segregation as for class ... ” applies, the segregation provisions ap plicable to that class in 7 . 2 . 4 shall be applied . However, for the purposes of interpreti ng 7 . 2 . 6 . 1, which permits substances of the same clas s to be stowed together provided they do not react dangerously with each other, the segregation provisions of the class as represented by the primary hazard class in the Dangerous Goods List shall be applied . For example: UN 2965 – BORON TRIFLUORIDE DIMETHYL ETHER ATE, class 4 . 3 The Dangerous Goods List entry specifies “S G5 (“segregation as for class 3)”, “SG8 (stow “away from” class 4 . 1)” and “SG13 (stow “away from class 8)”” . For the purposes of establishing the segre gation provisions applicable in 7 . 2 . 4, the class 3 column shall be consulted . This substance may be stowed together with o ther class 4 . 3 substances where they do not react dangero usly with each other, see 7 . 2 . 6 . 1 . 7.2.6.3 No segregation needs to be applied: .1 between dangerous goods of different cla sses which comprise the same substance but vary only in their water content, such as sodium sulphide in classes 4 . 2 and 8 or for class 7 if the differenc e is due to quantity only; .2 between dangerous goods which belo ng to a group of substances of different classes but for which scientific evidence exists that they do not react dangerously when in contact with each other . Substances within the same table 7 . 2 . 6 . 3 . 1, 7 . 2 . 6 . 3 . 2 or 7 . 2 . 6 . 3 . 3 are compatible with one another; and .3 to substances within the table 7 . 2 . 6 . 3 . 4, except that due regard shall continue to be t aken of the dangerous reactions specified in the provisions of 7 . 2 . 6 . 1 . 1 to 7 . 2 . 6 . 1 . 4 .

The scope of the assessment should include the package, the conveyance, the adjacent loading and unloading areas, and, if necessary, all other material which has been transported in the conveyance . When necessary, additional steps for th e protection of persons, property and the environment, in accordance with provisions established by the relevant competent authority, should be taken to overcome and minimize the consequences of such leakage or damage . 7.8.4.2 Packages damaged or leaking radioactiv e contents in excess of allowable limits for normal conditions of transport may be removed to an acceptable interim location under supervision, but should not be forwarded until repaired or reconditioned and decontaminated . 7.8.4.3 In the event of a nuclear or radiological emer gency during the transport of radioactive material, provisions as established by relevant national and/or international organizations, should be observed to protect persons, property and the environment . This includes arrangements for prepar edness and response established in accordance with the national and/or international requirements and in a consistent and coordinated manner with the national and/or international emergency arrangements . 7.8.4.4 Attention is drawn to the latest versions of b oth The EmS Guide: Revised Emergency Response Procedures for Ships Carrying Dangerous Goods and the Medical First Aid Guide for Use in Accidents Involving Dangerous Goods (MFAG) . 7.8.4.5 The arrangements for preparedness and re sponse should be based on the graded approach and take into consideration the identified hazards and their potential consequences, including the formation of other dangerous substances that may result from the reaction between the contents of a consignment and the environment in the event of a nuclear or radiological emergency . Guidance for the establishment of such a rrangements is contained in “Preparedness and Response for a Nuclear or Radiological Emergency”, IAEA Safety Standards Series No . GSR Part 7, IAEA, Vienna (2015); “Criteria f or Use in Preparedness and Response for a Nuclear or Radiological Emergency”, IAEA Safety Standards Series No .

Lighting and power cables and fittings sh ould be maintained in good condition . Cables or equipment found to be un safe should be disconnected . Where a bulkhead is required to be suitabl e for segregation purposes, cables and conduit penetrations of the decks and bulkheads should be sealed against the passage of gas and vapours . When stowing dangerous goods on deck, the po sition and design of auxiliary machinery, electrical equipment and cable runs should be considered in order to avoid sources of ignition . 7.8.5.2 Fire precautions applying to individua l classes, and where necessary to individual substances, are recommended in 7 . 8 . 2 and 7 . 8 . 6 to 7 . 8 . 9 and in the Dangerous Goods List . 7.8.6 Special fire precautions for class 1 7.8.6.1 The greatest risk in the handling and transp ort of goods of class 1 is that of fire from a source external to the goods, and it is vital that any fire should be detected and extinguished before it can reach such goods . Consequently, it is essential tha t fire precautions, fire-fighting measures and equipment are of a high standard and ready for immediate application and use . 7.8.6.2 Compartments containing goods of class 1 a nd adjacent cargo spaces should be provided with a fire-detection system . If such spaces are not protected by a fixed fire- extinguishing system, they should be accessible for fire-fighting operations . 7.8.6.3 No repair work should be carried out in a co mpartment containing goods of class 1 . Special care should be exercised in carr ying out repairs in any adjacent space . No welding, burning, cutting, or riveti ng operations involving the use of fire, flame, spark, or arc-producing equipment should be carried out in any space other than machinery spaces and workshops where fire-extinguishing arrangements are available, except in any emergency and, if in port, with prior authorization of the port authority . 7.8.7 Special fire precautions for class 2 7.8.7.1 Effective ventilation should be provid ed to remove any leakage of gas from within the cargo space or spaces, bearing in mind that some gases are heavier than air and may accumulate in dangerous concentrations in the lower part of the ship . 7.8.7.2 Measures should be taken to prevent leakin g gases from penetrating into any other part of the ship . 7.8.7.3 If there is any reason to suspect leakage of a gas, entry into cargo spaces or other enclosed spaces should not be permitted until the master or respon sible officer has taken all safety considerations into account and is satisfied that it is safe to do so . Emergency entry under other circumsta nces should only be undertaken by trained crew wearing self-contained breathing apparatus, and protective clothing when recommended, and always under the supervision of a responsible officer . 7.8.7.4 Leakage from pressure receptacles containing flammable gases may give rise to explosive mixtures with air . Such mixtures, if ignited, may result in exp losion and fire . 7.8.8 Special fire precautions for class 3 7.8.8.1 Flammable liquids give off flammable vapo urs which, especially in an enclosed space, form explosive mixtures with air . Such vapours, if ignited, may cause a “fla shback” to the place in which the substances are stowed . Due regard should be paid to the provision of adequate ventilation to prevent accumulation of vapours . 7.8.9 Special fire precautions and fire fighting for c lass 7 7.8.9.1 The radioactive contents of Excepted, Ind ustrial, and Type A packages are so restricted that, in the event of an accident and damage to the package, there is a high probability that any material released, or shielding efficiency lost, would not give rise to such radiological hazard as to hamper fire-fighting or rescue operations . 7.8.9.2 Type B(U) packages, Type B(M) packages and T ype C packages are designed to be strong enough to withstand severe fire without significant loss of contents or dangerous loss of radiation shielding .
