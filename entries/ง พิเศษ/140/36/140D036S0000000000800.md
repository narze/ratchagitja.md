A XII/Res.,491 - 6 - PREAMBLE 1 The Code of Safety for Nuclear Merchant Ships has been developed as a guide to Administrations on internationally accepted safety standards for the design, construc- tion, operation, maintenance, inspection, salvage and disposal of nuclear merchant ships. It supplements applicable international conventions, codes and recommendations adopted by the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organization (hereinafter referred to as "the Organization"). 2 This Code supersedes the Recommendations Applicable to Nuclear Ships annexed in Attachment 3 to the Final Act of the International Conference on Safety of Life at Sea, 1974. 3 Paramount to the provisions of the Code is the priority given to the two main safety objectives: .1 the protection of persons and of the environment, especially against unaccept- able hazards due to the intentional or accidental emission of ionizing radiations and the release of radioactive substances, both at sea and in ports; and .2 the safeguarding of the ship not only with respect to strictly nuclear hazards but also to those arising from interactions between the nuclear propulsion plant, the remainder of the ship, including. its cargo, the sea and the ship's environment. 4 While development of the Code has been based upon established and accepted ship- building, marine and nuclear engineering principles, it is recognized that review will be necessary as technology progresses. Initial application of the Code is restricted to conventional types of ships propelled by nuclear propulsion plants with pressurized light water type reactors. 5 To minimize the probabilities and consequences of failure of any nuclear com- ponent, system, structure or com bi nation thereof, the Code is based on a phi I osophy of the defence-in-depth concept whereby independent safety systems complement the basic integrity of the nuclear process systems.

- 9 - A XII/Res.,491 Term Component, active Definition A component whose functioning depends on an external input, such as actuation, mechanical movement, or supply of power, and which therefore influences system processes in an active manner.* (see "Component, passive") Component, passive * Examples of active components are pumps, fans, relays and transistors. It is emphasized that this definition is necessarily general in nature as is the corresponding definition of passive components. Certain components, such as rupture discs, check valves, safety valves, injectors and some solid-state electronic devices, have characteristics which require special consideration before designation as an active or passive component. A component which has no moving part and only experiences such changes as changes in pressure, in temperature or in fluid flow in performing its functions. In addition, certain components which function with very high reliability based on irreversible action or change, may be assigned to this cateqorv." (see "Component, active") * Examples of passive components are heat exchangers, pipes, vessels, electrical cables and structures. It is emphasized that this definition is necessarily general in nature as is the corresponding definition of active components. Certain components, such as rupture discs, check valves, safety valves, injectors and some solid-state electronic devices, have characteristics which require special consideration before designation as an active or passive component.

RESOLUTION A.491(XII) adopted on 19 November 1981 CODE OF SAFETY FOR NUCLEAR MERCHANT SHIPS

- 15 - CHAPTER 1 - GENERAL A XII/Res,.491 1 .1 Purpose 1.1.1 This Code is intended to provide a technical and regulatory reference for nuclear merchant ships. It supplements other applicable international conventions, codes and recommendations promulgated by the Organization and defines specific safety problems which shou Id be addressed. Appropriate criteria are included to protect people and the environment from radiological hazard throughout all phases of the ship's life cycle: design, construction, commissioning, operation and decommissioning. 1.1.2 Owing to the special features of nuclear energy and the mobility of a nuclear ship, international consensus is required on the provision of technical and administrative constraints during the vessel's life cycle. 1.2 Application The Code should be applied to new ships. The application of the Code to existing ships should be decided by the Administration to the extent it deems necessary. 1 .3 General safety principles 1.3.1 The overall safety of the nuclear ship is a primary objective .. The safety of the nuclear propulsion plant (NPP) is an integral part of this overall safety. It could be necessary, however, for the safety of the ship, to require operation of the NPP during periods when power wou Id otherwise be reduced or stopped if safety of the NPP were the sole consideration. Continued operation under such conditions should be decided on only after due consideration of the potential radiological hazard to the crew, the general public and the environment. 1.3.2 Radiological hazards present in a nuclear ship should be controlled to the extent necessary to ensure adequate protection for people and the environment. Measures to ensure the containment of radioactive materials and the attenuation of ionizing radia- tion should be taken when the ship is being designed, constructed, commissioned, operated and decommissioned. 1.3.3 NPP safety should not only reduce radiological risks but also, inter alia, those risks arising from concentrated energy sources, such as high pressure and high tempera- ture flu ids, by appropriate means to minimize the occurrence of accidents and the severity of their effects. 1.3.4 The provisions of this Code specifically address hazards that exist by virtue of the NPP of the ship, but Administrations should also recognize other hazards which affect conventionally powered ships and for which provisions have been made in other conventions or codes. 1.3.5 The following general principles should be adopted in meeting the requirements of the Code: .1 Releases of radioactive products, under any PPC, should be prevented or controlled to the dose-equivalent limits by the provision of a series of successive physical barriers between the nuclear fuel and the environment. This defence-in-depth concept requires that: RESOLUTION A.491(XII) adopted on 19 November 1981 CODE OF SAFETY FOR NUCLEAR MERCHANT SHIPS

A XII/Reso491 - 16 - .1.1 the fuel cladding, which is the first barrier, has among its functions the safety function of retaining radioactive fission products from the fuel; .1.2 the primary pressure boundary, which is the second barrier, has among its functions the safety function of preventing the unintentional release of radioactive material from the primary system; .1.3 the containment structure, which is the third barrier and totally contains the primary pressure boundary, has as its principal role the safety function of limiting the leakage of radioactive material from any contained equip- ment, under any PPC; and .1 .4 the safety enclosure, which is the fourth barrier, surrounds the containment structure and any significant source of radioactivity associated with the NPP and has as its principal role the safety function of preventing the unintentional release and limiting the leakage of radioactive material. .2 Protection against the effects of irradiation should be provided by applying, either singly or in combination, appropriate measures such as: .2.1 interposing adequate shielding; .2.2 establishing controlled areas of the ship; .2.3 limiting exposure times; .2.4 preventing the unnecessary approach of persons to sources of radiation; and .2.5 actions by the personnel in emergencies in accordance with plans and instructions . . 3 The design of the NPP should ensure that human action is not required to start or operate protection and safety systems during the initial period of an emergency situation. 1.3.6 Effective containment of radioactive material and attenuation of radiation should be assured through a series of arrangements whose efficacy can be demonstrated for all plant process conditions (PPCs). This series of arrangements should be based upon: .1 preventive measures ensuring high standards of design and execution, and adequate safety margins; .2 monitoring facilities for detecting any encroachment into these margins; and .3 means of action for preventing accident situations from developing or, failing that, for limiting consequences. 1.3.7 A nuclear ship should be designed, constructed, tested, inspected, operated and decommissioned under the quality assurance programme (OAP}. Principles of quality assurance are as fol lows: .1 For the NSSS and for its interface with the rest of the ship the basic require- ments for the establishment and implementation of the quality assurance programme are given in the IAEA Safety Series No. 50-C-OA and outlined in Appendix 5 of this Code. However, it should always be recognized that the RESOLUTION A.491(XII) adopted on 19 November 1981 CODE OF SAFETY FOR NUCLEAR MERCHANT SHIPS

- 17 - A XII/Reso491 basic responsibility for achieving quality in performing a particular task (i.e. in design, in manufacturing, in commissioning, in operation in decom- missioning) rests with those to whom the task is assigned and not with those seeking to ensure by means of verification that such quality has been achieved . .2 At all stages in the ship's life cycle, a single organization responsible for the management and control of the overall OAP shou Id be identified . . 3 In the event of a change of responsible organization, the transfer of responsi- bility should be so made that it does not interfere with the implementation of the OAP . .4 As a precondition to Administration approval for the construction of a nuclear ship, a OAP shou Id be developed by the responsible organization, describing the OAP to be fol lowed throughout the entire lifetime of the ship to ensure its compliance with the provisions of the Code and other applicable regulations and conventions . . 5 The complete description of the OAP should be included in the Safety Assessment approved by the Administration . . 6 The Administration or its competent authority should ascertain that the responsible organization establishes and implements the OAP in accordance with the provisions of this Code and with the commitments of the Safety Assessment . . 7 The OAP requirements shou Id be applied to structures, systems and compo- nents assigned to each of the safety classes . . 8 The extent to which the individual requirements should apply will depend upon: .8.1 the safety classification of the item; .8.2 the need for special controls, administrative measures and surveillance over processes, methods and equipment; .8.3 the degree to which compliance with design requirements can be demon- strated by inspection or test; .8.4 the quality, history and degree of standardization of the item; .8.5 the accessibility, including both physical and environmental consideration, of the component after installation in the plant for maintenance, in-service inspection and replacement. ' .9 However, in all cases a OAP consistent with the provisions of IAEA Safety Series No. 50-C-OA shou Id be implemented. 1 .3.8 The dose equivalent Ii kely to be received by persons on board or in the vicinity of the ship during norma I operation should be kept as low as is reasonably achievable and in any case not exceeding the dose-equivalent limits or, where they exist, the individual I imits set by the competent authoritv." * Reference is rnede to ICAP Publication 26. RESOLUTION A.491(XII) adopted on 19 November 1981 CODE OF SAFETY FOR NUCLEAR MERCHANT SHIPS

A XII/Reso491 - 18 - 1.3.9 As a general principle governing the acceptability of accident risks, the probability of occurrence of accident situations should be in inverse ratio to the severity of their consequences. In assessing accident situations, the possible interactions between the NPP, the ship, its cargo and its intended service must be considered. 1.3.10 For all NSSS safety and protection systems, and elsewhere if specifically required, the single failure criterion as defined in Appendix 6 and in 2.6.3 should apply. 1 .3.11 As a means of satisfying the single failure criterion in particular and of reducing the probability of failure of essential systems in general, four important concepts should be incorporated in the design of systems for nuclear ships. These provisions, which might be applied singly or in combination, are aimed at reducing the probability of system or component failure. They are: .1 redundancy - which refers to the replication of systems or components to provide excess capability for fulfilling an essential function; .2 independence - which requires that the functioning of one system does not rely in any way upon the functioning of another given system; .3 segregation - which means the physical separation of systems performing a common function to reduce the probability of concurrent loss from a common external cause; and .4 diversity - which means the protection of systems and components performing the same task from common mode failure, by having them differ from each other as regards design, operation, manufacturer, etc. 1.3.12 The following specific obligations should be imposed upon contractors and the responsible organization: .1 The responsible organization should ensure that in any contract that it negotiates with a constructor, all safety principles are followed and are supplemented by any additional provisions that this responsible organization may deem necessary; .2 Sub-contractors and prime contractors should bring to the attention of the prime contractor and of the responsible organization any additional measures they consider would effectively improve the application of the general safety principles; .3 At all phases of the ship's life cycle, a clearly designated authority should be appointed who is responsible to the Administration for the safety of the ship and its NPP. For the purpose of this Code, the designated authority is the responsible organization. In those countries where the Administration issues a licence to operate a nuclear ship, the responsible organization should also be the I icensee; and .4 The responsible organization for the safety of a nuclear ship should ensure that the ship's Safety Assessment is made available to host governmental authorities and kept up to date.

In the case of conventional ships, it is usually possible to prescribe in detail certain aspects of their design or construction by referring to a degree of risk that has been accepted on an empirical basis for a long period of time without ever having been defined. In the case of nuclear ships, which pose specific safety problems, a more systematic approach is essential. It is therefore appropriate to rank situations qual ita- tively according to their frequency and consequences. These two concepts are introduced as follows: .1 situations which are required to be considered in the design of the NPP are classified according to their likelihood of occurrence, which may range from continuous to extremely remote; .2 for each class of occurrence frequency, a consequence I im it is set - these I im its may be raised as the frequency of the postulated situation becomes lower. 1.4.2 Situations are defined in this Code as plant process conditions (PPCs). They are assigned to 4 classes of PPC according to their general frequency of occurrence and their consequences as indicated in table 1 .1. Typical examples of the classification of PPCs are given in 2.5. TABLE 1.1 PPC General description Like! ihood of occurrence Consequence class 2 3 4 Normal operation Minor occurrences Major occurrences Severe accident Continuous or frequent Infrequent Remote Extremely remote 2 3 4 Note: PPC 4 may be further subdivided into two categories. Category 4A should be used for those PPCs if some engineered enerqv sources a re available. Category 48 should be used if no engineered energy sources are available. 1.4.3 The frequency classification of PPCs corresponds to the following qualitative descriptions: if the PPC occurs continuously or is likely to occur often during the service life of a given nuclear ship; if the PPC will not occur often but is likely to occur several times during the lifetime of a given nuclear ship; if, in principle, the PPC shou Id not occur in the case of a given nuclear ship, but could occur in a few nuclear ships of the same type during their service I ife; . 1 continuous or frequent: .2 infrequent: .3 remote: RESOLUTION A.491(XII) adopted on 19 November 1981 CODE OF SAFETY FOR NUCLEAR MERCHANT SHIPS

A XII/Res~491 .4 extremely remote: - 20 - if, in principle, the PPC should not occur during the total service I ife of a certain number of nuclear ships of the same type, but is nevertheless possible. 1 .4.4 Consequences for each class of PPC are defined as follows: .1 Class 1 consequences: the ship and its NSSS operate with in the radiological limits for normal operation as defined in 6.3.1.1; .2 Class 2 consequences: those which arise from unplanned occurrences without disturbing significantly the operation of the ship and which do not result in a dose equivalent in excess of the relevant dose-equivalent limit for occupa- tionally exposed persons as measured at the ship's hull or at its vertical projection; .3 Class 3 consequences: those that may involve a limited unavailability of a ship, either singly or in combination; a degradation of the ship's structure or NPP equipment; injuries; the need for external assistance; but do not result in a dose equivalent in excess of the relevant dose-equivalent limit for occupationally exposed persons as measured at the ship's hull or at its vertical projection; .4 Class 4 consequences; those that may ultimately involve, either singly or in combination, loss of life or loss of the ship but do not result in a dose equivalent in excess of that laid down in 6.3.1.3 as measured at the ship's hull or at its vertical projection. 1 .4.5 The frequency class to which each postulated occurrence has been assigned, should be described in the Safety Assessment and supported by objective evidence. The Administration should ensure that the assignment of an occurrence to any particular frequency class is acceptable. 1.4.6 The consequences of each postulated occurrence examined should be analysed to an appropriate degree of detail in the Safety Assessment, and the resu Its shou Id be consistent with the general principles given in this section. 1.5 First commissioning of a nuclear ship and further surveys 1.5.1 Prior to building a nuclear ship, the Administration should review the preliminary plans and the Safety Assessment (see Appendix 3) and make further recom- mendations, if needed. 1.5.2 During the building phase, the Administration should carry out suitable surveys, mainly for quality assurance purposes but also to verify that the ship is built in conformity with the documents produced and with any added recommendations. 1.5.3 The Administration should then approve the pre-commissioning test programme and ensure the tests are carried out. 1 .5.4 After which, having reviewed the up-to-date documents and the test results the Administration could then authorize the commissioning and issue the certificate During all the phases of the life of a nuclear ship, the ship and its NPP should bf surveyed by the Administration, in particular to ensure compliance with the provis of the Code.

Intentional decommissioning refers to situations where the responsible organization or Administration considers that, for safety or any other reason, the ship should not be kept in service. Unintentional decommissioning occurs when a sea mishap or other cause renders the ship or its NPP unfit for service. 1 .8.2 In the case of temporary decommissioning, or during the initial phase of final decommissioning, the responsible organization should take monitoring and safety measures appropriate to the potential hazards, nuclear or other, according to the state of the ship and its NPP. The monitoring and safety teams should be given the necessary authority and facilities for dealing with any incident of internal or external origin involving the ship or its NPP. 1.8.3 The operations directly or indirectly concerned with the intentional or planned decommissioning of a nuclear ship should satisfy the requirement to protect man and his environment from unacceptable hazards that may be caused by the ship after its NPP has finally been shut down. 1.8.4 The likelihood of unintentional decommissioning, due to mishaps at sea, incidents of internal or external origin, acts of sabotage or any other unintended cause, should be considered during the design of the ship. Where appropriate, measures should be provided to prevent their occurrence or limit their consequences. RESOLUTION A.491(XII) adopted on 19 November 1981 CODE OF SAFETY FOR NUCLEAR MERCHANT SHIPS

A XII/Res.491 - 22 - 1.8.5 Where it is no longer possible to assure the overall safety of the ship, nuclear safety, which hitherto constituted one aspect of overall safety, should become the principal objective in both the short and long term. 1.9 Recovery following loss 1.9.1 The possible radiological consequences of the ship's sinking depend on the power level at which the NPP was operating beforehand, the various transients affecting it during the sinking process, and the final position of the wreck. The sinking also affects: .1 the continued supply of power and coolant, etc., to the NPP; and .2 the possibility of operating control and safety equipment. 1.9.2 Consideration of the feasibility of recovering the wreck or part of it should be reflected in the design where this proves technically possible. 1.9.3 The marking and the surveillance of the wreck should be arranged as far as practicable. CHAPTER 2 - DESIGN CRITERIA AND CONDITIONS 2.1 Basic criteria and safety functions 2.1.1 To ensure adequate safety during all PPCs, three basic safety criteria should be observed . . 1 Criterion A: Means should be provided adequately to shield radioactive sources and to minimize the potential for the release of radio- active substances, so that exposure of those on board, the public and the environment will be kept as low as is reasonably achievable . . 2 Criterion 8: Means should be provided to remove residual heat safely from the reactor core . . 3 Criterion C: Means should be provided to control and shut down the reactor safely and to maintain it in that state as long as necessary. 2.1 .2 The following safety functions are generally necessary to satisfy the criteria given in 2.1.1. However, it may be necessary to supplement these functions in cases of special designs . . 1 Safety functions necessary to achieve criterion A are: .1.1 to maintain acceptable integrity of the cladding of the fuel in the reactor core as the first barrier; .1.2 to maintain the integrity of the reactor primary pressure boundary as the second barrier; RESOLUTION A.491(XII) adopted on 19 November 1981 CODE OF SAFETY FOR NUCLEAR MERCHANT SHIPS

Requirements for materials, design, construction, testing, inspection and operation should reflect the assigned safety classification. The following typical allocation of safety classes is for general guidance only and is not intended to be a definitive requirement. 2.2.2 Safety class 1 (SC-1) applies to the following items: .1 Reactor protection system and the scram system; .2 The pressure vessel and components of or within the primary pressure boundary and core support structure whose failure could cause a PPC 3 or 4. Components connected to the reactor coolant system and forming part of the primary pressure boundary, need not be assigned to SC-1 , provided that: .2.1 for postulated failure of the component during normal reactor operation, the reactor can be shut down and cooled down in an orderly manner assuming make-up is provided by the reactor coolant make-up system only; or .2.2 the component is or can be isolated from the reactor coolant system by two valves. Each open valve must be capable of automatic actuation. The closure time should be such that in the event of postulated failure of the component during normal reactor operation, each valve remains operable and the reactor can be shut down and cooled down. in an orderly manner; and .3 The steam generator shell and main piping including the isolating valves on the steam line.

It should also be capable of being started from a dead ship condition, without external aid. 2.4.4 The astern power and the load change rate of the steam generators and turbines should be analysed to prove that the ship has a reasonably short emergency stopping distance. 2.4.5 NPP systems of SC-1 to 4 should be designed and constructed to perm it adequate testing of their condition and functions. Where they are subject to mechanical, thermal or pressure loading, their strength should also be tested. 2.4.6 Testing for functional capability should be possible on the ECCS, the reactor protection system and the residual heat removal systems. Testing, with the reactor in operation and with the primary system under pressure, should not interrupt the perfor- mance of safety functions, lower the level of redundancy of any system below the required minimum, nor impair necessary operation of the system. 2.5 Plant process conditions 2.5.1 As presented in table 1.1, PPCs are assigned to the 4 classes in accordance with their frequencies and consequences. Such classification of occurrences in the PPC should be considered as req u i rem en ts. Therefore in the Safety Assessment it shou Id be demon- st rated by objective evidence that the frequency and consequences of any occurrence is not higher than that corresponding to the class to which it is assigned. Differences in ship and NPP design, and in frequency or consequences, may dictate that a specific situation be assigned a different PPC class from that shown as guidance in this section.

The depth of the double bottom under the reactor compartment should provide protection against bottom damage of the extent given in 3.4.3, but in no case should the bottom of the safety enclosure be less than the greater of 8/15 or 2 metres above the bottom of the ship or be below the inner bottom plating. 3.6.2 A double bottom, of sufficient depth to withstand the assumed damage given in 3.4.3, should be provided under the propulsion machinery space. 3.6.3 Except where otherwise required by 3.6.1 and 3.6.2, double bottoms should be fitted in accordance with the requirements for non-nuclear ships of similar type and arrangements made to ensure structural continuity at transition areas. 3.6.4 An analysis of the ship's longitudinal strength to the satisfaction of the Administration should be made, assuming the ship is stranded. 3.7 Navigational aids and manoeuvrability 3.7.1 A nuclear ship should be fitted with an anti-collision aid and at least two radars, each capable of being operated independently.

Consideration should be given to: .1 use of fire-extinguishing agents that permit easy decontamination; .2 limited use of ionization detectors in spaces which may have high radiation levels; and .3 limiting or controlling hydrogen releases, originating from the process of radiolysis, or from zircalloy-water reaction following a LOCA. 3.9.4 Suitable design, the use of structural fire protection, and the use and placement of fire protection equipment should minimize the probability of hazard or damage to the NSSS and its control systems resulting from a fire in a non-nuclear section of the ship. 3.9.5 At least two means of escape should be provided from the main reactor control room and from the compartment in which the emergency reactor control position is located. Each escaperoute should provide effective fire shelter from the compartment to the weatherdeck. 3.9.6 Within spaces such as the reactor compartment and spaces containing equipment essential to the continued safe operation of the NSSS, the use of combustible substances and systems requiring combustible substances should be avoided to the greatest possible extent, provided that, where use of such substances cannot be avoided, appropriate equipment and management procedures should be described in the Operating Manual. 3.9.7 Systems within spaces such as the reactor compartment and spaces containing equipment essential to the continued safe operation of the NSSS or necessary to ship's operation, such as standby generating sets or auxiliary boilers, should be segregated and physically separated by structural fire protection and be provided with individual fire-extinguishing equipment. 3.9.8 The use of an emergency contra I position described in 3.1.13.6 should enable the reactor to be brought to a cold shutdown condition, and kept in a cold subcritical condition while maintaining residual heat removal functions, in the event of a fire in the main control room.

Calculation of thermal conditions should allow for uncertainties in calculations and shou Id take into consideration the effects on thermal performance of ship motions. Thermal margins including a minimum departure from nucleate boiling ratio should be established, to the satisfaction of the Administration, as operational limits. Calculations shou Id be supported by experi men ta I heat transfer correlations that consider the most extreme transient and ship motion conditions. Calculations should be made available to the host Administration as required. 4.2.2 Coolant flow distribution through the individual fuel channels in the core and uncertainties associated therewith should be taken into account. Particular attention should be accorded to the redistribution of coolant flow and effects on heat transfer and coolant properties under the influence of ship motions. For abnormal conditions of coolant flow, due to disturbances of pumping power or other causes, adequate safety margins should be demonstrated. Analyses and/or tests should demonstrate the absence or acceptability of any flow-induced vibration in the core, its supports or appurtenances, to ensure that no vibration-induced hazards exist which would prejudice safe reactor operation.

- 71 - A XII/Reso491 CHAPTER 6 - RADIATION SAFETY 6.1 General 6.1.1 This Chapter sets out the basic principles and requirements for radiological protection and radioactive waste management having a bearing on the design, construc- tion and operation of a nuclear ship. Elsewhere in the Code specific measures necessary to meet the requirements of this Chapter are dealt with in greater detail. 6.1.2 The expression "as low as is reasonably achievable" is used at frequent intervals throughout this Chapter and occasionally elsewhere in the Code. In the context of radiological protection, ICRP has indicated that the expression is intended to imply the optimization of radiological protection arrangements whereby activities involving exposure to radiation are carried out at a level of exposure (within dose-equivalent limits) such that further reduction would not justify the incremental cost required to accomplish it. The Commission's suggested procedure as to how such assessments might be carried out is outlined in paragraphs 72 to 76 of ICAP Publication 26, while further guidance specifically related to the release of radioactive materials to the environment is provided by IAEA in its Safety Series No.45. 6.2 Radiological protection design 6.2.1 The nuclear power plant and other sources of radiation should be designed and shielded so that during PPC 1, 2 and 3 all exposures are kept as low as is reasonably achievable and in any case within the relevant dose-equivalent limit. Distance and occupancy time, as vVell as shielding, should be considered for controlling exposure. 6.2.2 The design shou Id be such as to ensure that when the reactor is operating normally or is shut down, no persons on board or in the vicinity of the ship may as a result of the ship's operation be subjected to radiation or contamination levels in excess of limits laid down in accordance with 6.3.1. 6.2.3 Where appropriate, safety factors should be adopted at the design stage to provide margins for contingencies. 6.2.4 The design of the ship and its NPP should be such that there is no significant increase in the background radiation level of a port, due to the operation of a ship in PPC 1 and 2. 6.2.5 The ship should be divided into areas designated according to the actual or potential magnitude of the radiological hazard involved. Taking into account the nature of the radiological hazard in controlled and supervised areas, access barriers, protective clothing, personnel monitors, washing facilities and changing rooms should be located, as needed, between controlled or supervised areas and adjacent uncontrolled areas, to prevent the transfer of contamination from one area to another. Warning signs should be placed at the entrance to a controlled or supervised area to indicate the hazards. Access to a controlled area shou Id be limited to authorized persons and their entrance and ex it should be registered.

While the ship is in drydock, access to the ship's bottom may be limited administratively. 6.2.7 Within the uncontrolled areas it would be expected that, as far as is reasonably achievable, dose rates at power for PPC 1 and 2 would not exceed the values set out for guidance in Appendix 4. 6.2.8 The design should be such as to minimize, as far as reasonably achievable, the spread of radioactivity. All parts of the ship in which radioactive materials or contamination may exist should be identified and appropriate design measures taken to ensure that the spread of radioactive material or contamination into other parts will be minimized and that any necessary decontamination procedures can be carried out safely within the relevant dose-equivalent limit. 6.2.9 Consideration should be given to the potential for contamination of surfaces and equipment. Appropriate design measures shou Id be incorporated to minimize the difficulties of decontamination procedures and to permit proper control of the radio- active wastes which arise. Structural and surface irregularities should be avoided in all systems and equipment containing radioactive materials. 6.2.10 The design of the reactor and its associated plant (including the waste manage- ment installation), their shielding and containment provisions and their location on the ship should be such that any release of radioactivity arising from PPCs will not prevent the ship being moved within requirements of 6.3.1.3. 6.2.11 The dose equivalent from external irradiation, together with the committed dose equivalent arising from intakes of radioactivity, which cou Id be received at the outside surface of the hull or its vertical projection where appropriate should be within the requirements of 6.3.1.3 for any accident condition considered to be PPC 4. 6.2.12 Those parts of the ship which would be required to be occupied by either passengers or crew during any PPC 4 event shou Id be so located and/or shielded as to ensure that doses to personnel staying in such spaces for the whole course of the event would be within the requirements of 6.3.1. 6.2-.13 Arrangements shou Id be provided to ensure that servicing, maintenance and in-service inspection can be carried out safely, with neither unacceptable exposure of personnel to radiation nor unacceptable release of radioactive material to the environment. 6 .3 Protection of persons 6.3.1 Limits for radiation exposure and contamination levels: 6.3.1.1 Radiation doses received by the crew, other persons on board and members of the public, as a result of operation of the ship in PPCs 1, 2 and 3, should be kept as low as is reasonably achievable and within the appropriate dose-€quivalent limits recommended by ICRP. 6.3.1.2 Surface or airborne contamination as a result of PPCs 1, 2 and 3 should be within limits that are derived from the relevant dose-equivalent limits.

These are supple- mented by the quality assurance provisions and the ship's staff in-service inspection requirements described elsewhere in the Code. 8.1.2 Survey requirements are described in this Chapter under the heading of the three principal phases of the ship's life cycle, which are: .1 construction phase - which encompasses the period of design; selection and procurement of materials, components and systems; vendor and sub-contractor performance testing; fabrication; transportation and storage; and final assembly and erection; .2 trial phase - which encompasses the period of pre-operational testing, core-loading initial criticality, core physics testing, initial power operation and sea trials; and .3 operations phase - which encompasses the period from certification and initial entry into service (following sea trials) throughout the vessel's commercial life until retirement and preparation for decommissioning. 8.1 .3 Throughout the development of the above-mentioned phases, the Administra- tion or its competent authority should survey the nuclear ship through audit and/or inspection, as applicable, in order to verify that the responsible organization's activities connected with construction, trial and operation of the nuclear ship comply with the requirements of this Code and other applicable codes, standards and conventions. 8.1.4 Surveys shou Id ensure that: .1 materials and procedures used comply with the necessary quality level according to the design class of the component; .2 test results of material properties before and during manufacture comply with the specifications approved by the Administration; .3 manufacturing processes comply with quality assurance procedures required to assure the intended performance and reliability of surveyed components and systems; .4 components and systems are manufactured and examined in compliance with drawings and specifications approved by the Administration; .5 operation of components and systems complies with their specified functions, particularly safety functions, as described in Chapter 2; .6 the NPP and all associated safety systems meet the requirements of this Code and all other relevant safety requirements and specifications approved by Administration; and . 7 the ship and all systems essential to safety are maintained and continue to function properly throughout the ship's operating I ife.

A hydrostatic test should be used, unless it cou Id result in a risk of damage to the containment structure or its support or the equipment within, in which case pneumatic means may be utilized. Where the test temperature is less than the design temperature, the test pressure PT shou Id be determined in accordance with the formula: YT PT = 1.1 -- P yt where: YT = yield strength of shell material of containment structure at test temperature; Y t = y ie Id strength of shell material of containment structure at design temperature; P = design pressure (see 2.8.4.3.1 ); but in no case should the test pressure be less than 110 per cent of the design pressure nor should g~neral membrane stress exceed 0.90 YT for hydrostatic tests and 0.75 YT for pneumatic tests; .2 The test shou Id be witnessed by a surveyor and special precautions should be taken to protect personnel when air or gas under pressure is used as the test medium; .3 Following pressure testing, the containment structure should be visually and non-destructively examined for surface defects, flaws or cracks, to an extent acceptable to the Administration. Data from this examination should be the reference basis for later examinations; .4 Prior to startup for the first time, the containment structure should be tested for integral leaktightness.

Where leak prevention is based upon the maintenance of an underpressure within the safety enclosure of at least 100 pascals below that of surrounding compartments, the Administration may waive pressure leak testing. A pressure test should be made in any case where the safety enclosure is subjected to internal pressure above atmospheric pressure during those PPCs resulting in radioactive releases within the safety enclosure. 8.2.5 Pressure retaining, and other highly stressed components, should be tested in compliance with the following requirements; .1 Components of SC-1 or SC-2 (except containment structure: see 8.2.3.1) should be pressure tested to a pressure suitably in excess of their design pressures so as to conform to the approved rules under which the components were designed. Account should be taken of material properties and temperature in determining test pressures; .2 Components of SC-3 or 4 shou Id be pressure tested to a pressure suitably in excess of the design pressure; .3 Subject to .1 and .2 above, components and systems retaining radioactive liquid or gaseous substances or deposits should be pressure tested to not less than 1 bar overpressure and be examined for leaktightness.

A XII/Reso491 - 102 - APPENDIX 2 SEAWAY LOADS DEPENDING ON SERVICE PERIODS (see Chapter 2) General 1.1 For determination of seaway-induced loads on the ship and its machinery and equipment a model should be used describing the physical behaviour of the ship as exactly as possible. For the mathematical treatment the seaway and the induced seaway effects of the ship are connected by a response operator. This response operator allows the prediction of regular seaway effects like inertia forces at each location of the hull taking into account the characteristics of the ship under consideration. An essential assumption for mathematical treatment is that the seaway effect is I inearly proportional to the wave height. 1.2 The number of days of sea operation is connected with seaway-induced loads of the vessel. It is obvious that a longer duration of service periods not only increases the number of wave encounters and thus the number of load cycles, but also increases the probability of meeting higher waves and, due to the above assump- tion, higher stress levels. 2 Mathematical treatment 2.1 The irregular sea surface can be represented by superposition of simple harmonic waves of different periods, amp I itudes and directions. The phase relationships of these various component waves are considered to be random. The mathematical description is given by the seaway function where h( t) = surface elevation An = surface wave amplitude w ::: circular frequency = 2tr/T T ::: period, time between successive crests € = random phase lag 2.2 Any seaway can then be characterized by an energy spectrum S(w) which indicates the amount of energy of each different component wave.

As the phase lag in the seaway function is random the function itself is random too which permits the application of probability theory. Observed irregular wave records follow approximately the Gaussian distribution of statistics.

Control should be exercised to ensure integration and continuity of quality assurance provisions where work is subcontracted or where a transfer of primary responsibility occurs. 3 Documentation and records 3.1 Measures shou Id be established and documented to control the preparation, review, approval, issuance, revision and recall of all documents essential to activities affecting quality. 3.2 Control measures should be established and documented which assure that all applicable design provisions, such as regulatory requirements, applicable codes, standards and design bases are identified and properly applied. 3.3 Quality assurance records should be maintained for all aspects of the OAP. Records shou Id present objective evidence of qua I itv control and should include data on reviews, inspections, tests, audits, monitoring of work performance, material analyses, power plant operation logs, failures and deficiencies, repairs and other appropriate data. Quality assurance records should be collected, stored and maintained to provide ready reference. 4 Control procedures 4.1 Design control procedures should verify the adequacy of the design through the use of design reviews, alternative methods of calculation, critical assessment of design assumptions and the performance of suitable tests. Design changes shou Id be subject to the same level of control as were applied to the original design. 4 .2 Well documented measures shou Id be established to ensure that al I app I icable regulatory requirements, design bases, standards, specifications, performance criteria and other necessary data are included or referenced in procurement documents for components and services. Purchased items and services should be subject to control to assure their conformance with procurement specifications. RESOLUTION A.491(XII) adopted on 19 November 1981 CODE OF SAFETY FOR NUCLEAR MERCHANT SHIPS

A XII/Reso491 - 124 - 3 All these considerations must be recognized when applying the concept of single failure criterion. Consequently: .1 The concept is reserved for those systems important to the safety of the NSSS . . 2 The concept addresses the ability of a safety system as a whole and not each of the safety system's subsystems to perform the system function, following the failure of any component in the system. In simpler terms, the single failure criterion is applied to the safety system and not to each of its subsystems, even if each of these subsystems is able by itself to perform the system function. 4 A system is that total means made up of electrical, fluid and mechanical components by which a given function is accomplished. Additionally, a system may consist of a number of subsystems. A subsystem may be categorized by the type of component it includes, such as electrical, fluid or mechanical or the subsystem may itself contain al I the components necessary to perform the system function. Together, the subsystems combine to provide the total means by which a stated function is accomplished and are collectively referred to as the "system". 5 The systems to which the concept should be applied are, for example, the protection system, the residual heat removal system, the emergency core cooling system, the containment heat removal system, the containment isolation systems, the containment atmospheric clean-up system and the cooling water system. These are the systems that are required to ensure safe reactor startup operation at power, shutdown and maintenance of the shutdown conditions under al I PPCs. 6 The single failure criterion is not assumed to be applicable to normal operation. For other PPCs the single failure criterion should be incorporated in the design by the use of the principle of redundancy, diversity, independence, separation or, where necessary, by the provision of a safety system. 7 This criterion is a deterministic principle to be used when designing reactor safety systems in addition to other requirements, such as quality assurance and reliability analyses. In general, single failures are postulated in the case of passive as wel I as active components, for design basis accidents. 8 In conducting the single failure analysis the failure of a passive component designed, manufactured, inspected and maintained in service to an extremely high qua I itv level may net need to be assumed. However, when it is assumed that a passive component does not fail, such an analytical approach shall be justified, taking into account the total period of time, after the initiating event, that the component is required. 9 In general, the single failure criterion is applied to the electrical and fluid components, including component cooling water, in a particular safety system. An exception to the rule, however, occurs in those cases where a safety system does not have a dedicated electrical source, or where a particular electrical source supplies more than one safety system. If either of these situations exists, then the electrical power sources must be considered as a separate safety system and the single failure criterion applied to it. 10 Single failure criterion is not to be applied in the case of PPC 4b.

- 125 - A XII/Reso491 4.3 A basic consideration in the evaluation and selection of suppliers should be their capability to provide items and services which fully comply with the requirements of the procurement document. 4.4 Measures should be established for the identification and control of items, including subassemblies, so that they can be readily identified during installation and use. Associated control documentation shou Id be available for items as they pass through the various stages of processing. 4.5 Processes and procedures used in the fabrication, handling, installation, testing and operation of systems and components, should be continuously monitored to ensure that originally checked quality performances are not degraded. 4.6 The OAP shou Id prescribe the action required to detect, identify and rectify any defects that prejudice the proper functioning of any equipment or system to which the OAP applies. Failures, malfunctions, deficiencies, deviations, defective or incorrect material and equipment or any other relevant non-conformity should be reviewed and approved remedial action undertaken. 5 Testing 5.1 An approved test programme should be established which provides for the scheduling, identification, performance standards, procedures and documentation of all tests required to fulfil the requirements of the OAP. The test programme should include appropriate procedure and equipment qualification tests, prototype qualifica- tion tests, proof tests prior to installation, pre-operational and startup tests and in-service tests. Testing and measuring devices used for tests should be controlled and frequently calibrated to maintain accuracy within prescribed limits. 5.2 The scope of quality assurance tests should be specified, as necessary, for the relevant documents, materials, structures, components or systems involved. Inspection and test personnel procedures and qualifications should be described. , APPENDIX 6 APPLICATION OF SINGLE FAILURE CRITERION 1 The single failure criterion is a design principle which states that the performance required of a safety system will be achieved despite the random failure of a component of the system. 2 A single failure is assumed to occur in those- safety systems which have been designed to mitigate the effect of an initiating event. Accident analysis should be carried out, assuming a combination of an initiating event together with any other failures which occur as a direct result of the initiating event and, in addition, a random failure of any single component which is necessary for performance of a safety function which is intended to mitigate the effects of the initiating event.
