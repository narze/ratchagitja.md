MSC. 1/Circ.1588/Rev.1 Annex, page 2 I: \ CIRC \ MSC \ 01 \ MSC.1 - CIRC.1588 - Rev.1.docx Foreword This EmS Guide contains guidanc e on Emergency Response Procedures for Ships Carrying Dangerous Goods including the emergency schedules (EmS) to be followe d in case of incidents involving dangerous substances, materials or articles, or harmful substances (marine pollutan ts), regulated un der the International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code (IMDG Code) . This edition takes into account the Amendment 40 - 20 to the IMDG Code . The EmS Guide will be further amended as and when necessary to reflect amendments made to the IMDG Code .

MSC.1/Circ.1588/Rev .1 Annex, page 3 I: \ CIRC \ MSC \ 01 \ MSC.1 - CIRC.1588 - Rev.1.docx Preamble The purpose of this Guide is to provide guidance for dealing with fires and spillages (leakages) on board ships involving th e dangerous goods listed in the International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code (IMDG Code) . In accordance with the Inte rnational Safe ty Management Code (ISM Code), all ships, and the companies responsible for their operation, are required to maintain a safety management system (SMS) . Within the SMS, procedures for responding to potential shipboard emergencies are required . This Guide is intended to assist shipowners, ship operators and other parties concerned with developing such emergency response procedures, which should be integrated into the ship’s contingency plan . In November 1997, the IMO Assembly adopted resolution A . 852(20) on Guidelines for a structure of an integrated system of contingency planning for shipboard emergencies , which were further revise d by resolution A . 1072(28) in December 2013 and amended by its Corr . 1 in May 2014 . This Guide should be integrated i nto Mod ule IV on Response actions, as contained in paragraph 3 . 2 . 4 . 6 of the latter resolution, for cargo - related incidents . In the event of a fire or spillage incident, initial actions should be carried out in accordance with the shipboard emergency plan . Wh ere dangerous goods are involved, the responses in the emergency plan should be based on this Guide for specific dangerous goods having re gard to, inter alia, the type of ship, the quantity and type of packaging of the dangerous goods and whether the goo ds are stowed on or under deck .

MSC. 1/Circ.1588/Rev.1 Annex, page 4 I: \ CIRC \ MSC \ 01 \ MSC.1 - CIRC.1588 - Rev.1.docx How to use this Guide 1 The guidance contained in this Guide is intended for fire and/or spillage (leakage ) emergencies on board a ship involving packaged dangerous goods transport ed in accordance with the provisions of th e IMDG Code . The Guide should not be used for emergencies involving bulk cargoes or any other fire and/or spillage on board a ship which doe s not involve packaged dangerous goods as cargo . 2 This guidance is for shipboard use where master and crew have to r e spond to a fire or a spillage without external assistance . The recommendations are based on the fire safety provisions contained in chapter II - 2 of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974 as amended, and the provisions of the IMD G Code . The guidance should be integrated into the contingency plan for shipboard emergencies, which should be specific to the individual ship and should take into account the equipment on board . 3 There are international and national requirements for ship s to contact or report to the nearest coastal State when an incident takes place involving the loss or likely loss of packaged dangerous goods ( see Reporting procedures) . Contacting shore - based experts at an early stage irrespective of how insignificant t he in cident may seem to be is recommended . However, it should be noted that shore - based personnel or rescue/ coastguard experts may use different techniques to fight a fire or to deal with spillage on board a ship . 4 In this Guide, there is separate advice for fi re and spillage emergencies which should be consulted accordingly . 5 This Guide should be used as follows: .1 for fire and spillage, read and inc orporate into the ship’s training regime the INTRODUCTIONS to the emergency schedules , before any emergency occurs; .2 in the event of an emergency involving packaged dangerous goods, consult the GENERAL GUIDELINES as a first step; and .3 o btain detailed advice for the specific cargo(es) involved by reading the relevant EMERGENCY SCHEDULE(S) (EmS) for the cargo(es) .

MSC.1/Circ.1588/Rev .1 Annex, page 5 I: \ CIRC \ MSC \ 01 \ MSC.1 - CIRC.1588 - Rev.1.docx Fir e Introduction to the emergency schedules for FIRE 1 Be prepared 1.1 Preventing a fire from occurring is the most important part of a shipboard saf ety programme . However, once a fire has started, a well trained crew is the best defence for bringing the fire un der control . Given the complexity of extinguishing a fire involving dangerous goods, it is essential that the advice in this Guide be incorpora ted into the ship’s training regime so that the crew will be able to respond to a fire casualty in a time ly and e ffective manner . 1.2 This Guide should be integrated into a safety management system (SMS) . Procedures contained in the shipboard emerge ncy plan sh ould be tailored to the individual ship . 1.3 The firefighting procedures within the EmS SCHEDULES are diff erent for “ on deck” and “under deck” stowage . For specific ship types (e . g . hatchless containerships) or cargo holds (e . g . open vehicle d ecks of ferries), these two procedures have to be assigned specifically to the individual ship . 1.4 Given the toxic n ature of some of the dangerous goods involved, accommodation spaces should be protected from fire and smoke as far as possible (e . g . water s pray) . Therefore, th e ventilation systems for working and living spaces should be shut off, closed and secured to reduce the possibil ity of vapours, dusts and gases penetrating these spaces . In some instances, it may be necessary to turn the ship’s accom modation spaces upwind , if possible . 1.5 The safety of firefighting personnel is most important . Use of appropriate protective clothing (i . e . a firefighter’s outfit when dealing with a fire) and self - contained breathing apparatus, to protect skin and lungs from toxic and/or corrosi ve liquids, vapours, dusts and gases, is essential . This equipment should be suitable f or each individual member of the firefighting team, as working with such equipment requires a high level of fitness and training . It should be kept in mind that even a w eak acute illness may interfere with a crew member’s fitness . In addition, pregnant c rew members should not be ex posed to dangerous vapours . 1.6 It is also essential to ensure that there is always an escape route for firefighting personnel despite the limitati ons due to narrow exit paths and the danger of falling overboard . 2 Identification o f the dangerous good(s) involv ed 2.1 It is essential to identify the dangerous good(s) involved in the fire in order that the specific EmS FIRE SCHEDULE(S) for the cargo(es) may be consulted and appropriate action taken . This is important because some dangero us goods are incompatible with so me firefighting media and could exacerbate the situation (e . g . use of a water - based extinguishing medium on water - reactive cargoes) . 2.2 An ident ification number with four digits preceded by the letters “UN” is assigned to a ll dangerous goods . From the UN Nu mber, it is possible to find the appropriate EmS FIRE SCHEDULE . The Dangerous Goods List in part 3, chapter 3 . 2, of the IMDG Code contains the names and the UN numbers, as well as the EmS SCHEDULE NUMBERS . The special Dangerous Goods Manifest and the detai led Stowage Plan required by SOLAS regulation VII/4 . 2 will also contain the proper shipping name and UN number of the dangerous good(s) concern ed . Packages will usually be labelled as well . 2.3 Specific information as t o properties of dangerous goods m ay also be found in the Dangerous Goods List in the IMDG Code . Dangerous goods are classified and labelled according to their hazards . Labels and marks on packages provide a warning of the general risks to be encountered . Personnel should understand the labelling system . 2.4 Emergency preparedness should form part of the ship’s Safety Management System as required by the ISM Code . Prepared information can re duce errors during a fire emergency . Therefore, it is recommended that the EmS SCHEDULE(S) be identified and incl uded on the Dangerous Goods Manifest and Stowage Plan recording the stowage position of the cargo . That will enable key members of the crew to know in advance which emergency procedures could be necessary . I n the event of a fire, the allocation of a specif ic EmS FIRE SCHEDULE via identification of cargo

MSC.1/Circ.1588/Rev.1 Annex, page 6 I: \ CIRC \ MSC \ 01 \ MSC.1 - CIRC.1588 - Rev.1.docx via the UN number takes time and is open to error, especially in mixed cargoes in one contain er . Furthermore, some firefighting procedures may require speci fic media and operations could be affected by the stowage location of such media . The advice given in the EmS FIRE SCHEDULE should be directly usable based on the stowage information, without t ime - consuming identification and location of the cargo involve d . 3 Cool and suffocate 3.1 In general, fires require h eat (energy) and oxygen to start burning . Only a limited number of chemicals do not need oxygen from the air . Therefore, the aim of firefighting is to exclude oxygen and to cool the cargo(es) . On board ship, this is generally carried out by using water spr ay or gas extinguishing systems . 3.2 Some burning cargoes will need special firefighting media (like dry inert material) to suffocate the fire . In s uch circumstances, normal firefighting procedures are of ten impracticable, and concentrating on cooling nearby c argo and ship structures is recommended in such cases . 3.3 Firefighters should be made aware of the hazards of opening doors of an over - heated space or freight container which is suspected of containing cargo on fire . There may be a lack of oxygen inside and f resh air from outside the space may instantly start a fire, and cause a flashback that could injure the firefighters . Cool down the container fi rst! 4 Seek advice 4.1 Expert advice should be sought irre spective of how insignificant the fire may seem to be when dealing with dangerous goods fires . Such advice could be given by: .1 ship operating companies (e . g . designated persons); .2 emergency information cen tres (such as CHEMTREC in the USA); .3 specialized ag encies; .4 professional responders; .5 port State authorities; .6 coast guard; .7 fire brigades; and .8 manufacturers of the products . 5 Evacuation Within some EmS FIRE SCHEDULES the phrase “Sudden or short - term events (e . g . explosions) may endanger the safety of the sh ip” or the phrase “The danger of uncontrolled spread of fire shou ld be considered” has been introduced . Depending on the type of sh ip and on the volume of dangerous goods allocated to this specific FIRE SCHEDU LE, it may be necessary to consider abandoning the ship at an early stage . In this case, the master should be aw are of the hazard and should decide whether the ship requires ass istance . 6 Firefighting media 6.1 Water 6.1.1 Water is the obvious firefighting medium at sea and is recommended for most fires involv ing dangerous goods . However, it should be noted that shore - based f irefighters may use a different medium . 6.1.2 When water is applied to a burning cargo, the temperature is reduced and the fire will be extinguished wh en the temperature drops below the ignitio n point . However, water is not suitable to extinguish all fires invol ving dangerous goods . Different firefighting media should be used if so indicated on the specific EmS FIRE SCHEDULE . 6.1.3 If the fire is under deck, c onsideration should be given to the sta bility of the ship when flooding the hold with water . 6.1.4 Some dangerous goo ds will react chemically with water, producing flammable and/or toxic gases . The most effective way to extinguish a fire involving these dangerou s goods is to smother them with a dry inert powdered material . However, the availability of suitable inert mate rial on boar d is limited . It may also be dangerous to approach the fire in order to use inert material properly . Consequently, the most appropria te method of extinguishing the fir e may be to use copious quantities of water . This would have an overall cooli ng effect on the fire even though the water may react with the dangerous goods involved .

MSC.1/Circ.1588/Rev.1 Annex, page 7 I: \ CIRC \ MSC \ 01 \ MSC.1 - CIRC.1588 - Rev.1.docx 6.1.5 Ships are equipped with a number of dual - purpose spray/ jet nozzles as required by SOLAS . Most EmS FIRE SCHEDULES recommend that the nozzles be set to spray when used to fight fires . Water spray may also be achieved by using water jets from some distance . This method of producing water spray is generally recomm ended . However, it is dangero us to direct a water jet onto the fire at close range because this could result in the spread of burning material . 6.1.6 The term “copious quantities of water” used within the EmS FIRE SCHEDULES refers to the minimum total quantities of water provided for optim al firefighting using four jets of water, as required by SOLAS regulation II - 2/10 . The master and crew should know the practical limitations that may be encoun tered at specific stowage locations in this respect . 6.1.7 Following the ad vice “use copious quantiti es of water” or “water spray from as many hoses as possible” may interfere with the s afety of the ship with regard to the ship’s stability . Stress forces on the hull due to increased quantities of water in the ship should be consi dered . 6.2 Fixed gas fire - e xtinguishing systems 6.2.1 If a fixed gas fire - extinguishing system is used for incidents und er deck, all hatches and vent dampers should be closed and ventilation shut off before the system is activated . If smoke is seen coming from arou nd the hatches, the lea ks should be sealed with any suitable material available . 6.2.2 The majority of the fixed gas fire - extinguishing systems use carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), but some use nitrogen (N 2 ) as the extinguishing medium . The instructions on board should be followed . The fire c ontrol plan will sometimes specify a given volume of gas to be applied to a given space . No advantage will be gained by exceeding this volume of gas where burning dangerous goods are involved . 6.2.3 It is important to realise that it will tak e an appreciable t ime for the space to cool after the fire has been extinguished . Therefore it would be extreme ly dangerous to reopen the hatches since the extinguishing gas would escape and air would enter the space again, thus allowing the fire to re - ign ite . The ship’s on - board instructions for such cases should be followed . 6.2.4 Fixed gas fire - extinguishing systems a re not effective against all fires . EmS FIRE SCHEDULES may contain specific information in this regard . 6.3 Fixed pressure water spraying systems 6.3.1 In some ships ( e . g . ro - ro ships and car ferries), some cargo spaces may be fitted with a water drencher or spray system instead of a fixed gas fire - extinguishing system . There will be instructions on board which should be followed . 6.3.2 A closed cargo space shoul d be vent ilated to clear it of smoke and toxic gases after the fire has been extinguished and the space has coo led . The ventilation equipment should be of a certified safe type for smoke removal . Evidence that the space is cooling down can be obtained by m onitori ng adjacent bulkheads and decks . Thereafter, a firefi ghting team should look for any small remaining fir es and inspect the surrounding cargo . After the fire has been extinguished, the cargo should be kept under surveillance until its normal temperat ure i s reached . 6.4 Foam In general, foam is an effective firefighting medium for fires involving flammable liquid s . The foam forms a layer on the liquid thereby excluding oxygen and reducing heat . However, it is less effective on solid substances on fire . Mo s t foams contain wa ter and should not be used on fires where the use of water is restricted because of adverse chemical reaction . 6.5 Dry chemicals Dry chemicals may be an effective extinguishing medium for fires involving water - reactive substances and metals . The dry chemical should not react with the dangerous goods involved in the fire . Some dangerous goods require a specific dry chemical to extingui sh a fire . 7 Dangerous goods exposed to fire 7.1 Rupture and cooling 7.1.1 Where possible, packages should be remove d f rom the vicinity of the fire . In general, heated material will expand, thus needing more volume and creating pr essure in the package . This will affect the integrity of the package which could lead to rupture and dispersal of the contents . Effective c ooling can lower the possibility o f rupture .

MSC.1/Circ.1588/Rev.1 Annex, page 8 I: \ CIRC \ MSC \ 01 \ MSC.1 - CIRC.1588 - Rev.1.docx 7.1.2 Where there is a danger that heat will have already started to cause a chemical or physical change to the dangerous substance, packages should not be moved . Care should always be exercised, for example, with those su bstances liable to polymerize, as this reaction may continue for a long time after the removal of the heat sour ce . Provided no discharge or pumping overboard problem arises, cooling should continue for many hours after the fire has been extinguish ed . After heat evolution has ceased, cooling with water may be stopped . A careful watch should be kept on the stability of the ship . 7.1.3 The EmS FIRE SCHEDULES advise that a number of dangerous goods should be removed or jettisoned if there is a likelihood of their inv olvement in a fire . However, where full or nearly full cargo transport units are involved, such guidance may be impractical . In that case, the advice should be taken to indicate that the goods are particularly dangerous . Personnel on board s hould fight the fire and cool nea rby cargo as far as possible . It should be borne in mind that some heated dangerous goods may have already damaged the packaging or may explode during handling . Consequently, moving or jettisoning burning cargo should onl y be attempted wi th utmost cautio n . 7.2 Spillage 7.2.1 It should be remembered that leakage of dangerous goods can be very dangerous for the crew and for the ship . Fire and explosion can rupture nearby packages or tanks, creating a spillage . 7.2.2 If a leak is discove red, the hazards ass ociated with that leak should be ascertained immediately . In cases involving leaks of flammable liquids or flam mable gases (class 3 and class 2 . 1 labels respectively), the crew should withdraw to a well - protected position . Air - vapour and air - gas mixtures a re liable to explode and such an explosion may injure crew members and damage the ship . 7.2.3 Many toxic gases are od ourless and colourless . A number of liquids will produce toxic vapours if exposed to heat . In an emergency, the ship sh ould be manoeuvred to keep the bridge, living quarters and crew upwind as far as possible . 7.2.4 The EmS SPILLAGE SCHEDULES should be consulted when dealing with a leakage . 8 Personal protection 8.1 Ship’s personnel 8.1.1 Many vapours and gases of dangerous goods produc ed by a fire are hazardous t o health . In the case of fire, the use of a firefighter’s outfit and self - contained breathing apparatus is esse ntial . Only trained personnel should use this equipment, which should be well maintained . Particular attention sho uld be given to ensuring that t oxic vapours or fumes do not penetrate occupied areas of the ship (e . g . bridge, living quarters, machinery spac es, working areas, etc . ) . 8.1.2 According to the ship’s fire emergency plan, ventilation systems to living and worki ng spaces should be shut off, close d and secured to reduce the possibility of vapours, dusts, and gases from penetrating these areas . 8.2 Firefightin g team 8.2.1 Chapter II - 2 of SOLAS requires firefighter’s outfits, full chemical protective suits and self - containe d breathing apparatus to be readily available on board . Masters are reminded that personnel will need regular training in the use of self - contained breathing apparatus and that special attention should be given to ensure that face masks fit satisfactorily at all times . 8.2.2 Self - contained breathi ng apparatus is essential for firefighting because dangerous goods on fire produce various substances hazardous to health . Handling water jets from some distance or cooling of heated cargo may not require the use of s elf - contained breathing apparatus . Howe ver, decisions not to use self - contained breathing apparatus should be undertaken carefully and on a case - by - ca se basis . 8.2.3 Firefighting outfits offer only limited protection from dangerous goods . Firefighting outfits are not chemical suits . Chemical protecti ve clothing is designed to protect against specific properties of chemicals . In general, there will be no such thing as a single type chemical protective suit on board . Therefore, contact with dangerous goods sh ould be avoided . Chemical protective clothing is not resistant to fire or heat . 9 First aid and actions after termination of firefighting 9.1 Any contamination w ith hazardous material should be immediately removed from the skin and then washed, for example with copious quantities of water . Information on medical first aid is provided in the IMO/WHO/ ILO Medical First Aid Guide for Use in Accidents Involving Danger ous Goods (MFAG) published by IMO . Be prepared to use the MFAG!

MSC.1/Circ.1588/Rev.1 Annex, page 9 I: \ CIRC \ MSC \ 01 \ MSC.1 - CIRC.1588 - Rev.1.docx 9.2 Cargo may re - ignite after a f ire has been extinguished . An efficient patrol shou ld be maintained in the spaces in which the fire occurred and in any adjoining spaces to ensure that any new ig nition or leakages are dealt with promptly . Fire - extinguishing systems should remain on stan d - by . Post a fire watch . 9.3 After extinguishing the fire , all emergency team personnel should ensure that all contamination of equipment and protective clothing is rem oved and washed immediatel y . Equipment should be restored and re - stowed for use . 9.4 There a re reporting procedures under SOLAS and MARPOL which have to be followed (see Reporting procedures) . 10 Special notes on classes of dangerous goods 10.1 Explosives – class 1 10.1.1 In the event of a fire, everything should be done to prevent the spread of the fire to co ntainers which contain class 1 goods . If it is not possibl e to prevent the spread of the fire, all personnel should immediately withdraw from the area . 10.1.2 Many explosives w ill burn to the point of an explosion . The master’s main concern will be whether or not there is likely to be a mass explosion . Such an explosion could damage the ship . If goods of division 1 . 1 or division 1 . 5 are involved, this likelihood will exist . The time between fire reaching the explosives and the subsequent mass explosion wil l be of the order of a few seconds to minutes . The master should a scertain how large a quantity of such explosives is involved . A few kilograms are unlikely to sink the ship, bu t above this a clear risk to the safety of the crew and the stability of the ship should be considered . Sudden or short - term events may endanger the safety of the ship . 10.1.3 Explosives of divisions 1 . 2, 1 . 3, 1 . 4, and 1 . 6 are unlikely to explode en masse . Irres pective of the division of the explosives, any firefighting should tak e place from behind substantial cover . If the risk to firefighters is too h igh, hoses could be lashed to the rail or other sui table fixtures and left unmanned . 10.1.4 Neither exclusion of air n or the use of smothering material is likely to be effective against a fire involving explosives . The use of the largest possible quantity of wate r in the shortest possible time is the only means of attempting to prevent a rise in temperature that could aff ect the chemical stability of the explosives . 10.1.5 Some dangerous goods of this class have been wetted or immersed in water . As they dry, they become unstable . The master should seek advice ( see section 4 above) . 10.2 Gases – class 2 10.2.1 Gases are substances usually tr ansported in cylinders, flasks, portable tanks, aerosol dispens ers and bottles under varying degrees of pressure . The gases may be flammable, tox ic or corrosive and may be compressed, liquefied or refrigerated . 10.2.2 Gases will not start burning at the valve, un less there has been an ignition source nearby (e . g . fire or heat) . The location of the burning gas needs to be identified because it may be the h eart of the fire . The heating of the receptacle is the most serious danger because of the possibility of ruptur e, rocketing or explosion . In the event of a fire, recep tacles containing gas should be liberally sprayed with water to keep them as cool as poss ible . 10.2.3 Non - burning le akages from receptacles of flammable gases may give rise to explosive mixtures in air . If a fire caused by the ignition of leaking gas is extingu ished within a cargo space before the leak is stopped, accumulation of gas will occur . This will result in an explosive mixture or a toxic or suffocating atmosphere . The EmS SPILLAGE SCHEDULES should be consulted . 10.2.4 Extremely low temperatures around leaka ges of some liquefied gases are an additional hazard (other than flammability and toxicity) . E mergency teams should avoid contact with such leakages and the immediate vicinity . 10.3 Flammable liquids – class 3 10.3.1 It is dangerous to direct a jet of water onto a fire involving flammable liquids . Many flammable liquids float on water and the water jet would spread the liquid, thus creating a greater danger . Closed containers exposed to fire will become pressurized a n d a rupture will occur . 10.3.2 Heated flammable liqui d will release vapours that may start burning instantly with explosive effect . Consequently, firefi ghting personnel should stay in a well - protected position and use water spray on the area of the fire . This wil l cool down the temperature of the liquid an d the air - vapour mixture

MSC.1/Circ.1588/Rev.1 Annex, page 10 I: \ CIRC \ MSC \ 01 \ MSC.1 - CIRC.1588 - Rev.1.docx 10.4 Flammable solids, self - reactive substances, solid desensitized explosives a nd polymerizing substances – class 4.1 10.4.1 This class of substances includes flammab le solids, water - wetted explosi ves (i . e . desensitized explosives) and sel f - reactive substances . 10.4.2 Flammable solids will easily ignite, and the appropriate EmS FIRE SCHEDULE shoul d be consulted . In the event of a fire, water - wetted explosives (i . e . desensitized explosives) will effectively have the properties of a class 1 prod uct . The special notes on class 1 explosives (see 10 . 1) and the relevant EmS FIRE SCHEDULES should be consu lted . 10.4.3 Self - reactive substances are sometimes transported under temperature controlled conditions where the cont rol temperature will depend upon th e specific properties of the substance being transported . If the control temperature is exceeded, the refriger ation unit has to be inspected . If the temperature control cannot be restored, the manufacturer should be consu lted as soon as possible . The ma nufacturer should be sim ilarly consulted if smoke is observed . The cargo should then be kept under surveillance . 10.5 Substances liable to spontaneous combustion – class 4.2 10.5.1 This class of substances includes pyrophoric substances , which will instantly burn on contact with air, and self - heating substances, which lead to spontaneous combustion . 10.5.2 Although the use of dry inert powdered material to smother the fire would be the preferred option, in most circumstances such a procedure ma y not be possible . Two metho ds of dealing with such fires are possible: .1 controlled burning: stay in a well - protected position . Let the goods burn . Many goods of this class react dangerously with water: refer to the relevant EmS FIRE SCHEDULE . In such cases , contact with water may intensify burning . Therefore, it is not recommended to apply water directly on the burning goods . When portable water mo nitors providing water s hield function are available: generate a water screen to prevent spread of fire . The fi re involving the goods should be left to burn out completely . If the fire has already spread to the adjacent cargo which is not reacting with wat er (see relevant EmS F IRE SCHEDULE): fight this fire from a safe distance; .2 fight the fire from a safe distance: if the location of t he fire makes it possible, copious quantities of water should be used immediately . Although the goods on fire will react wit h water and create heat, a large quantity of water will cool down the reaction and prevent further heat radiati on . However, water should not be used when the location of the fire makes it impossible to apply copious amounts of water directly onto the goods . Refer to the relevant EmS FIRE SCHEDULE . 10.6 Substances which, in contact with water, emit flammable gases – clas s 4.3 10.6.1 This class of substances reacts violently with water, evolving flammable gases . The heat of the reaction is sometimes sufficient to initiat e a fi re . 10.6.2 Although the use of dry inert powdered material to smother the fire would be the preferred option, in most circumsta nces such a procedure may not be possible . Two methods of dealing with such fires are possible: .1 controlled burning: stay in a well - protected position . Let the goods burn . All goods of this class react dangerously with water: refer to the rel evant EmS FI RE SCHEDULE . Contact with water will intensify burning . Therefore, it is not recommended to app ly water directly on the burning goods . When portable water monitors providing water shield function are available: generate water screen to prevent spread of fire . The fire involving the goods should be left to burn out completely . If the fire has alre ady spread to adjacent cargo which is not reacting with water (see relevant EmS FIRE SCHEDULE): fight this fire from a safe distance; .2 fight the fire fro m a saf e distance: refer to the relevant EmS FIRE SCHEDULE, since it is possible that firefighting with water may intensify the fire and generate the evolution of flammable gases which could explode in mixtures with air . 10.7 Oxidizing substances – class 5.1 10.7.1 T his cl ass of substances is liable to evolve oxygen and therefore to accelerate a fire . These substances, while in themselves not necessarily comb ustible, may cause the combustion of other material (e . g . sawdust or paper) or contribute to the fire, lead ing to an explosion . 10.7.2 Fires in which these substances are present are difficult to extinguish, because the ship’s firefighting installation may not be effective . Everything possible should be done to prevent the spread of fire to containers containing these dan g erous goods . However, if fire reaches the cargo, personnel should be withdrawn immediately to a well - protected position .

MSC.1/Circ.1588/Rev.1 Annex, page 11 I: \ CIRC \ MSC \ 01 \ MSC.1 - CIRC.1588 - Rev.1.docx 10.8 Organic peroxides – cl ass 5.2 10.8.1 This class of substances is liable to burn vigorously . Some substances have a low decomposition tempe ra ture and are transported under temperature controlled conditions, where the control temperature will depend upon the specific properties of the s ubstance being transported . 10.8.2 If the temperature co ntrol cannot be restored, the manufacturer should be consul ted as soon as possible even if evolution of smoke has ceased . The cargo should then be kept under surveillance . The surrounding area should be kept isolated because liquid may be ejected from re lief arrangements . 10.9 Toxic substances – class 6.1 Substance s of t his class are poisonous by contact or inhalation, and the use of self - contained breathing apparatus and firefighters’ outfits is therefore essent ial . 10.10 Infectious substances – class 6.2 These are substances which are known or reasonably expe cted to c ontain pathogens (i . e . micro - organisms that are known or reasonably expected to cause infectious disease in humans or animals) . Pathogens may survive th e fire and self - contained breathing apparatus should therefore be used . 10.11 Radioactive materi al – clas s 7 10.11.1 Many ra dioactive materials are transported in packages designed to retain their containment and shielding in accidents . However, under extreme fire cond itions, failure of containment or loss of shielding or criticality safety could result in significa nt hazard to personnel . Long - term exposure of any class 7 package to extreme heat should be avoided and in emergencies they should be kept as cool as possibl e using copious quantities of water . If a packaging of radioactive material has been exposed to a ny significant fire, expert advice should be sought . Suspected contamination of safety and firefighting equipment should be removed as quickly as possible . 10.11.2 Som e packages may have a class 7 label and other hazard labels . Such additional hazards may be gr eater than the ra diation hazard . In that case, actions as specified in the applicable EmS FIRE SCHEDULE should be followed . 10.11.3 Although radiation monitors are not re quired by regulation on board ships, applicable relevant provisions on segregation, separati on or radiation pro tection programmes (e . g . section 1 . 5 . 2 and paragraph 7 . 1 . 4 . 5 . 18 of the IMDG Code) or the INF Code may require monitors on board . For ships carryi ng radiation monitoring equipment, monitoring of radiation levels is recommended . 10.12 Corrosive substances – class 8 These substances are extremely dangerous to humans, and man y may cause destruction of safety equipment . Burning cargo of this class will produ ce highly corrosive vapours . Consequently, wearing self - contained breathing appa ratus is essential . 10.13 Miscellane ous dangerous substances and articles and environmentally hazardous substances – class 9 This class includes those substances, materials and arti cles which are deemed to possess some danger, but which are not classified with in the criteria of classes 1 to 8 . No general guidelines are applicable to these goods . They have been allocated to the relevant EmS FIRE SCHEDULE according to their hazards in the event of a fire . 10.14 Marine pollutants 10.14.1 A number of substances within all of the above classes have also been d esignated as marine pollutants . Packages containing these substances will bear a marine pollutant mark . 10.14.2 In the case of leakage resulting from bur ning cargo, it is important to be aware that any spillage of a marine poll utant which is washed overboard will pollute the sea . It is, however, more important to fight a fire on board a ship rather than to prevent pollution of the sea .

MSC.1/Circ.1588/Rev.1 Annex, page 12 I: \ CIRC \ MSC \ 01 \ MSC.1 - CIRC.1588 - Rev.1.docx General guidelines for FIRE • Think safety first! • Avoid any contact with dangerous substanc es . • Keep away from fire, smoke, fumes a nd vapours . • Sound the fire alarm and start firefighting procedures . • Keep the bridge and living quarters upwind if possible . • Locate stowage positi on of cargo that is burning or evolving smoke . • Identify cargo . • Obt ain UN numbers and the EmS FIRE SCHEDULE of t he dangerous goods involved . • Consider which measures of the EmS FIRE SCHEDULE are applicable and should be followed . • Check if other dangerous goo ds may potentially be involved in the fire and identify the rele vant EmS FIRE SCHEDULE . • Wear suitable protectiv e clothing and self - contained breathing apparatus . • Be prepared to use the Medical First Aid Guide (MFAG) . • Contact the designated person of the co mpany responsible for the operation of the ship or a rescue c oordination centre to obtain expert advice on da ng erous goods emergency response measures . Precaution: Contamination of the skin with dangerous goods should be removed and washed immediately .

MSC.1/Circ.1588/Rev.1 Annex, page 25 I: \ CIRC \ MSC \ 01 \ MSC.1 - CIRC.1588 - Rev.1.docx Spillage Introduction to the emergency schedules for SPILLAGE 1 Be prepared 1.1 Incidents involving dangerous goods may result in spil lages from such go ods, and the magnitude of the effects of an incident depends upon the type and amount of product released, together with the type of any other product involved and whether the spillage is on deck or in enclosed sp aces . 1.2 Spillages could cre ate additional haz ards to those indicated by classification and labelling of the dangerous goods (e . g . the spillage of a flammable liquid may create an explosive atmosphere) . Of particular concern are leakages of reactive chemi cals, w hich in contact with o ther materials or further spillages will produce additional or other chemicals (e . g . toxic gases) . 1.3 When dealing with a spillage on board a ship, the value of crew training and of familiarity with the general contingency plan will become evident . Drills and exercises specifi c to the cargoes on board at the time should be a part of shipboard routine . 1.4 This Guide should be integrated into the ship’s Safety Management System . Procedures contained within the shipboard emergency plan have to be tailored to the ind ividual ship . Spil lage response procedures within the EmS SPILLAGE SCHEDULES are differentiat ed for “on deck” and “under deck” stowage . For specific ship types (e . g . hatchless containerships) or cargo spaces (e . g . o pen vehicle decks of ferries) these two p rocedural categori es have to be assigned specifically to the individual ship (e . g . run - off considerations concerning bilges and drains) . 2 Personal protection 2.1 The safety of the emergency personnel is of paramount importance . 2.2 The likelihood of the developmen t of an explosive, flammable or toxic atmosphere should be considered . 2.3 Full protective clothing resistant to the effects of the specific dangerous substance involved should be worn . The protective clothing sho uld cover all skin so that no part of the body is unprotected . We aring self - contained breathing apparatus is essential to protect against inhalation of toxic or corrosive dusts, vapours or gases . 2.4 Emergency teams should avoid direct contact with any dange rous goods regardless of the protective clothing being used . If dir ect contact takes place when dealing with a spillage, the contact time should be kept to a minimum . 2.5 It is a requirement of SOLAS that four sets of full protective clothing resistant to ch emical attack should be provided in addition to fir efighters’ outfits . 2.6 Firefighters’ outfits are not designed to protect against chemical hazards and chemical - resistant clothing is not designed to protect against fire . Masters are reminded that personnel should have regular training in the use of self - cont ained breathing ap paratus, and that special attention should be paid to ensuring that face masks fit satisfactorily at all times . 2.7 Responders should also ensure that any chemical protective clothing is u sed with other suitable protection against the specifi c hazards involved . 3 General respo nse 3.1 The safety of the emergency personnel is most important . 3.2 Working spaces and living quarters should be protected by water spray wherever possible . Ventilation sys tems for living quarters and working spaces should be shu t off, closed and secured to red uce the possibility of smoke, dust, fumes and gases from entering these areas . Particular care should be given to ventilation inlets (e . g . machinery and accommodati on spaces) . It may be necessary to turn the ship to ensure t hat the accommodat ion spaces are upwind .

MSC.1/Circ.1588/Rev.1 Annex, page 26 I: \ CIRC \ MSC \ 01 \ M SC.1 - CIRC.1588 - Rev.1.docx 3.3 Before entering cargo holds or compartments, the emergency personnel should determine the oxygen content of the space’s atmosphere and should test for the presence of dangerous vapours . I f a confined space entry is attempted, the use of self - contained breathing apparatus is essential . Only trained personnel should use this equipment, which should be well maintained . 3.4 It is essential to ensure that the re is always an escape route for emergency personnel despite the limited means of e scape due to narrow exit paths and the danger of falling overboard . 3.5 Decontamination and medical first aid also need to be considered . Arrange for a decontamination station to be set up at a suitable safe location . 3.6 The general response to spillage involving dangerous goods can be subdivided into the following tactical objectives: .1 Identification; .2 Rescue; .3 Isolation; and .4 Response . Experience from previous incidents has shown that these objectives can normally be achieved in this order . 4 Identi fication of the da ngerous goods involved 4.1 It is essential to identify the dangerous good(s) involved in the spillage in order that the specific EmS SPILLAGE SCHEDULE(S) for the cargo(es) may be consulted and appropriate action taken . This is important becau se some dangerous goods are incompatible with some media available for dealing with a spillage . 4.2 An identification number with four digits preceded by the letters “UN” is assigned to ea ch dangerous good . From the UN number, it is possible to find the approp riate EmS SPILLAGE SCHEDULE . The Dangerous Goods List in part 3 of chapter 3 . 2 of the IMDG Code contains the names and the UN numbers, as well as the EmS SCHEDULE numbers . The Dang erous Goods Manifest and the Stowage Plan required by SOLAS regulation VII/4 . 2 will also conta in the proper shipping name and UN number of the dangerous good(s) concerned . Packages will usually be labelled as well . 4.3 Specific information as to properties of dangerous goods m ay also be found in the Dangerous Goods List in the IMDG Co de . Dangerous good s are classified and labelled according to their hazards . Labels and marks on packages provide a warning of the general risks to be encountered . Personnel s hould understand the labelling system . It will also be beneficial to consult other sources of inform ation . A safety data sheet provided by the manufacturer may be one such source of additional information . Seek expert advice from manufacturers, speciali zed agencies or prof essional responders . 4.4 Emergency preparedness should form part of t he ship’s Safety M anagement System as required by the ISM Code . Prepared information can reduce errors during a spillage emergency . Therefore, it is recommended that th e EmS SCHEDULE(S) be identified and included within the Dangerous Goods Manifest and Sto wage Plan, so dire ctly connected to the stowage position of the cargo . This will enable key members of the crew to know in advance which emergency procedures would be necessary . In the event of a spillage, the allocation of a specific EmS SPILLAGE SCHEDULE via identificatio n of the cargo via the UN number takes time and is o pen to error, especially in mixed cargoes in one container . Furthermore, some spillage response procedures may require specific use of material which could be hampered by an inaccessible stowage location . After locating the spillage area, the advice give n in the EmS SPILLAGE SCHEDULE should be directly available from the Dangerous Goods Manifest an d Stowage Plan . 5 Rescue 5.1 The safety of personnel should be the highest priority . One of the f irst concerns afte r evaluating the situation of the incident is fi nding and rescuing victims . This includes searching for and evacuating persons who may be expos ed or who are disoriented or disabled by the release . It might be necessary to rescue persons f rom elevated place s or confined spaces or those who are pinned u nder wreckage . 5.2 Appropriate equipment will need to be available, and prior training is essential for such circumstances . 6 Isolation 6.1 The objective of isolation is to limit the number of personne l exposed to the s pilled material . This may be achieved by simply roping or taping off dangerous areas . Consider sealing off ventilation, air conditioning a nd other openings to living and worki ng spaces .

MSC.1/Circ.1588/Rev.1 Annex, page 27 I: \ CIRC \ MSC \ 01 \ MSC.1 - CIRC.1588 - Rev.1.docx 6.2 At sea, the master has the capability and discreti on to alter course and speed to ensure that dangerous gases or vapours are kept away from personnel, living quarters or ventilation inlets . 6.3 Consider the evacuation of passengers and members of the crew . 7 Response 7.1 At sea, human and other resources are limit ed . So in most cas es involving spillage of dangerous goods, the most effective response will probably be to wash the substance overboard or jettison i t . Attempts to repack dangerous goods may expose personnel to unreasonable risks . 7.2 The response to the spil lage should be in accordance with the appropriate EmS SPILLAGE SCHEDULE(S) for the dangerous good(s) involved in the incident . The emergency team s hould take all reasonable precautions when dealing with the spillage and remember that the safety of personne l is most importan t . 8 Seek advice 8.1 Always seek expert ADVICE when dealing with dangerous goods spills . Such ADVICE could be given by: .1 ship operati ng companies (e . g . designated persons); .2 emergency information centres (such as CHEMTREC in the USA); .3 specialize d agencies; .4 profes sional responders; .5 port State authorities; .6 coastguard; .7 fire brigades; and .8 manufacturers of the products . 9 Materials to be us ed 9.1 Water is the obvious medium to be used when dealing with a spillage on board a ship . It is recommended in the m ajority of cases t o be used in copious quantities to wash the spillage overboard . However, certain dangerous goods react violently with wate r, producing flammable and toxic vapours . Others, for example marine pollutants, will produce pollution if washed ov erboard . 9.2 The term “copious quantities of water” used within the EmS SPILLAGE SCHEDULE(S) refers t o the minimum total quantities of water p rovided for optimal firefighting with four jets as defined by SOLAS regulation II - 2/10, Construction requirements . Mas ter and crew shoul d consider practical limitations at specific stowage locations in this respect . 9.3 Inert material should be used for spil lages where it would be dangerous to use water . The inert material should be dry . 9.4 Sawdust should not be used as it is li able to be ignited by ignition sources or in contact with a number of substances . Cement may be used as an inert material for barrica ding . 9.5 An electric discharge may ignite some materials (e . g . explosives) . Therefore, the use of non - certified safe type equi pment within spill age areas may be dangerous . For some materials, “non - sparking footwear” is recommended (e . g . rubber boots wi thout metal parts) . 10 Action after spillage has been dealt with 10.1 Decontamination of personnel, clothing and ship’s structures 10.1.1 After the spillage has been dealt with, the emergency team personnel should ensure that all contamination of equipment and protect ive clothing is removed and washed immediately . All equipment should be restored and re - stowed for further use . 10.1.2 Areas not affected initially may have been contaminated during response procedures . Crew members coming in contact with improperly decontamin ated areas may become contaminated . Clean the site thoroughly before any unprotected personnel are allowed to ent er . 10.1.3 Contaminated mate rial should be pro perly disposed of or be cleaned .

MSC.1/Circ.1588/Rev.1 Annex, page 28 I: \ CIRC \ MSC \ 01 \ MSC.1 - CIRC.1588 - Rev.1. docx 11 First aid 11.1 Information on medical first aid is provided in the IMO/W HO/ILO Medical First Aid Guide for Use in Accidents Involving Dangerous Goods (MFAG) . Be prepared to use the MFAG! 11.2 Any contamination of t he skin with a dan gerous substance should be immediately removed and then washed, for example with water . Radio for e xpert advice if personnel have been exposed to dangerous goods . 12 Special notes on specific dangerous goods classes 12.1 Based on the specific pr operties of the in dividual dangerous goods listed under one UN number, experts have allocated the substances, articl es and materials to EmS SPILLAGE SCHEDULES . The allocation has not been based on the classification and lab elling of the substances only . Ho wever, to help the mariner who is used to the handling and labelling of packaged dangerous goods to understand the advice given in the EmS SPILLAGE SCHEDULES, this introduction based on classification properties of substances is given . 12.2 Explosives – class 1 12.2.1 Properly package d explosives are unlikely to detonate unless exposed to a fire or source of ignition . Within t he divisions of this class, there are differences in explosive power . From a mariner’s standpoint, the volumes of explosives concerned are of pr imary importance f or the safety of the ship . However, even small volumes of spilled material may ignite and i n jure individual crew members . In general, spilled explosive substances are less hazardous when kept wet (see SPILLAGE SCHEDULE S - X) . 12.2.2 Some explosiv e mixtures are sta bilized in such a way that water will separate explosives from the stabilizer, thus creat i ng a higher risk . The explosive component becomes very sensitive to shock and heat . The explosive should be kept mixed under water and washed overbo ard . Wetted articl es should be jettisoned (see SPILLAGE SCHEDULE S - Y) . 12.2.3 Some ammunition types contain a t oxic material or a tear - gas substance . In addition to the explosive hazard, the toxicity hazard has to be realized . Use of self - contained breathing appa ratus is essential (see SPILLAGE SCHEDULE S - Z) . 12.3 Gases – class 2 12.3.1 A release of a flammable gas (class 2 . 1) is the preliminary step leading to a potential vapour cloud explosion (VCE) . For a blast to take place, the substance has to mix with air in a quantit y that will allow the mixture to form a cloud . As soon as a fr iction (electrostatic potential) lie s within the explosive range and encounters an ignition source, a flash fire, a deflagration or, sometimes, even a detonation may occur, with devastating cons equences . In deali ng with gas leakages, let the gas evaporate and drift away . Keep away all sour ces of ignition . Water spray could reduce the ignition potential of the cloud (see SPILLAGE SCHEDULE S - U) . 12.3.2 Non - toxic, non - flammable gases (class 2 . 2) may displa ce oxygen, creatin g a suffocation hazard . Ventilation of all areas concerned is important (s ee SPILLAGE SCHEDULE S - V) . 12.3.3 Toxic gases (class 2 . 3) when released may fill an area of the ship or a compartment with a toxic atmosphere . Therefore, it is important t o shut off, close and secure all ventilation supplying the accommodation, machinery space s and bridge to protect against such gases . Self - contained breathing apparatus is essential for the emergency team (see SPILLAGE SCHEDULE S - U) . 12.3.4 Liquefied gases can cau se the additional hazard of very low temperatures around the point of leakage . Such a leakage will be particularly dangerous when the leakage is in the liquid phase from a container where very low temperatures will be experienced . The emergency team should avoid contact wit h liquefied gases if at all possible . 12.3.5 Oxidizing gases can react vi olently with a number of organic materials . These reactions can generate heat, produce flammable gases and are liable to ignite combustible materials . 12.4 Flammable liquids – class 3 12.4.1 The releas e of a vaporized flammable liquid is the preliminary step leadin g to a potential vapour cloud explosion (VCE) . For a blast to take place, the vapour has to mix with air in a quantity that will allow the mixture to form a cloud . As soon as a friction (elect rostatic potential) lies within the explosive range and encoun ters an ignition source, a flash fire, a deflagr ation or, sometimes, even a detonation may occur, with devastating consequences . Water spray will reduce the vaporization and th e ignition potenti al of the cloud . Keep away all sources of ignition (see SPIL LAGE SCHEDULE S - D) .

MSC.1/Circ.1588/Rev.1 Annex, page 29 I: \ CIRC \ MSC \ 01 \ MSC.1 - CIRC.1588 - Rev.1.docx 12.4.2 At high concentrations, many flammable liquids exhibit a narcotic effect (which is not labelled accordingly), a short - term potentially lethal effect (which i s identified by a class 6 . 1 label) or a long - term toxic effect (not labell ed) . In all cases, the us e of self - contained breathing apparatus is therefore recommended (see SPILLAGE SCHEDULE S - D) . 12.4.3 Some flammable liquids are corrosive to human skin, the ship’s hull or normal per sonal protection equipment . Their vapours are toxic b y inhalation . Therefore, washing of spillages and forcing vapours overboard with water spray is the method of choice . I t is important to close all ventilation to protect the accommodati on and machinery s paces and the bridge from the vapours . Crew member s should stay away from any effluent (see SPILLAGE SCHEDULE S - C) . 12.4.4 Many flammable liquids are not soluble in water and will float on the water (e . g . mineral oil, gas oil, petroleum) . In gen eral, high concent rations of these substances are not lethal but exhibit a narcotic effect . The crew should be aware of that and s tay away from highly concentrated vapours . Mineral oil is considered to be a marine pollutant although not classified nor labe lled as such . Depe nding on the quantities, oil spilt into the sea may cause problems and is usually given a high profile by the media . In case of spillage on board, the dominating hazard is flammability . Keep away all sources of ignition (see SPILLAGE SCHE DULE S - E) . 12.5 Flamma ble solids, self - reactive substances, so lid desensitized explosives and polymerizing substances – class 4 12.5.1 This class contains many different substances and varying hazards within its three sub - classes . Many are not solids . Some of these m aterials require s pecial agents to be used for cleaning/ absorbing as they react unfavourably with water, sand or other ine rt material . The procedures and materials to be used in case of a spillage are identified in ten different schedules . 12.5.2 Spilled flammabl e solids may creat e an explosive atmosphere that could be ignited easily . Whereas some solids (e . g . articles) can be repacked (see SPILLAGE SCHEDULE S - I), others will contaminate ships’ surfaces, which have to be cleaned thoroughly by washing the substance s overboard (see S PILLAGE SCHEDULE S - G) . 12.5.3 A few fla mmable substances are transported in a molten state . To clean contaminated areas, the use of inert materials is possible to enable the emergency team to shovel up the spillage and dispose of it overboard (s ee SPILLAGE SCHEDU LE S - H) . 12.5.4 Flammable solids that exhibit explosive properties when spilt from a package should be kept wet and disposed of overboard . Drying material being ignited (e . g . by heat or friction) would lead to a detonation (see SPILLAGE SCHEDULE S - J) . 12.5.5 Temperature - controlled self - reactive substances are also classified as flammable soli ds under class 4 . 1 . Spillage is often connected to a failure of temperature control, leading to chemical reaction and creating a fire hazard . If not disposed of ove rboard, the releva nt FIRE SCHEDULE should be consulted (see SPILLAGE SCHEDULE S - K) . 12.5.6 Some spontaneously combustible substances could react with water (see SPILLAGE SCHEDULE S - L) . Smothering with dry inert material and the immediate disposal overboard could limit the ignition hazard . Others will ignite within minutes (see SPILLAGE SCHEDUL E S - M) and firefighting will be necessary (see FIRE SCHEDULE F - G) . 12.5.7 Depending on the chemical properties, substances which are dangerous when wet (class 4 . 3) could be collecte d and disposed of overboard (see SPI LLAGE SCHEDULE S - P), or could be kept dry and disposed of overboard or could be washed overboard with copious quantities of water even though a reaction with water will occur (see SPILLAGE SCHEDULES S - N and S - O) . The use of water spray is recommended in c ase of the development of flammable gases (see SPILLAGE SCHEDULE S - O) . 12.5.8 Many flammable solids, substances liable to spontaneous combustion and most substances that are dangerous when wet are hazardous to health by skin con tact or by inhalat ion of dust . Th e use of self - contained breathing apparatus and appropriate chemical protection (e . g . chemical suit) is therefore recommended in all cases . 12.6 Oxidizing substances and organic peroxides – class 5 12.6.1 Dangerous goods of class 5 co ntain oxygen, and some will ig nite combustible material on contact . In general, contact with substances of class 5 will be harmful to the skin, eyes and mucous membranes . The use of self - contained breathing apparatus and appropriate chemical protection (e . g . chemical suit) is there fore recommended . 12.6.2 Spilled oxidizing substances (class 5 . 1) could ignite combustible material or destroy materials (e . g . personal protection) by their chemical react ivity . Such spillages should be washed overboard . All crew members should stay away fr om effluent (see SPILLAGE SCHEDULE S - Q) .

MSC.1/Circ.1588/Rev.1 Annex, page 30 I: \ CIRC \ MSC \ 01 \ MSC.1 - CIRC.1588 - Rev.1. docx 12.6.3 Organic peroxides (class 5 . 2) are highly reactive and some may explode when ignited . Class 5 . 2 liquids are flammable liquids which should be kept away from all sources of ignition . These substan ces will instan tly destroy eyes . Some substances are tran sported under temperature control which is necessary to prevent reaction (mostly noticed as smoke evolution) and development of heat which may lead to fire (see SPILLAGE SCHEDULE S - R) . 12.7 Toxic and inf ectious subst ances – class 6 12.7.1 The effects of toxic substances (class 6 . 1) may appear at once during exposure to them or may be delayed until after exposure . Inhalation is the major route for vapours, gases, mists and dusts . Skin and eye contact is of concer n for the emergenc y team . The use of self - contained breathing apparatus and appropriate chemical protection (e . g . chemical suit) is recommended in all cases . Vapours of toxic liquids may fill an area of the ship or a space with a toxic atmosphere . Therefor e, in case of vapo ur development, it is important to shut off, close and seal off all ventilation leading to accommodation and machinery spaces and the bridge (see SPILLAGE SCHEDULE S - A) . 12.7.2 Some toxic substances are also flammable . In this case, the safety a dvi ce for both fla m mable and toxic liquids should be followed (see SPILLAGE SCHEDULE S - D) . 12.7.3 In case of spillage of toxic substances, be prepared to use the MFAG . 12.7.4 The substances of class 6 . 2 are infectious, biological products, diagnostic specimens, clinical waste, etc . I n c ase of spillage of such substances, different types of a biohazard may develop . Some spilled goods of class 6 . 2 could create illness of crew members after skin contact or inhalation . Whereas washing overboard is advised for on - deck sp illa ge, waiting for ex pert ADVICE is recommended for under - deck spillages . Any skin contact or inhalation of mists or dus ts should be avoided . Expert ADVICE is particularly important in respect of exposure risk, decontamination methods and reporting proc edures (see SPILLAGE SCH EDULE S - T) . 12.7.5 Most toxic substances and many infectious substances are also toxic to marine animals . Consult safety data sheets or experts for individual properties if needed . 12.8 Radioactive material – class 7 12.8.1 Many radioactive materi als are t ransported in pack ages designed to retain their containment and shielding under accident conditions . Failure of the containment resulting in spillage that could be a significant hazard to personnel would only be expected un der very severe conditi ons . Damp surfaces on undama ged or slightly damaged packages are seldom an indication of packaging failure . If a packaging of radioactive material appears to have leaked its accidental contents, expert ADVICE should be sought . 12.8.2 Some packages may have bot h a class 7 l abel and other haz ard labels . Such additional hazards may be greater than the radiation hazard . In that case, actions as specified in the applicable SPILLAGE SCHEDULES should be followed . 12.8.3 Although radiation monitor s are not required by regu lation on board ships, applicable relevant provisions on segregation, separation or radiation protection programme (e . g . section 1 . 5 . 2 and paragraph 7 . 1 . 4 . 5 . 18 of the IMDG Code) or the INF Code may require monitors on board . For ships carrying rad iation monitoring equipme nt, monitoring the extent of contamination is possible . 12.8.4 Spillage may constitute a release of any solid, liquid or gaseous radioactive material from its packaging . Personal protection material and equipment on board cannot general ly provide protection again st the health effe cts of penetrating ionizing radiation . Therefore, to protect personnel from the potential effects of radiation from spilled cargo (which may include the release from the packaging of special form radioactive ma terial), two parameters are important when res ponding to spillages of these materials: TIME and DISTANCE . Entry of personnel into the area involvi ng the spill of radioactive material should be limited to the shortest time possible, and the distance betwee n the spillage and any person nel should be maxi mized . In addition, radiation contamination of personnel by inhalation, ingestion or skin contact s hould be of concern, and appropriate protective actions should be taken (protective clothing and self - contain ed breathing apparatus is reco mmended in all cas es) (see SPILLAGE SCHEDULE S - S) . 12.9 Corrosive substances – class 8 12.9.1 Corrosive solids and liquids can permanently damage human tissue . Some substances may corrode steel and destroy other materials (e . g . perso nal protection equipment) . Corrosi ve vapours are hig hly toxic, often lethal by destroying lung tissue . All corro sive chemicals will be dangerous to human health (toxic) . Avoid direct contact with the skin, protect against inhalation of vapours or mists . The use of self - contained breathing apparatus and appr opriate chemical protection (e . g . chemical suit) is reco mmended in all cases . Washing spillages and forcing vapours overboard with water spray is the method in all cases . It is important to shut o ff, close and secure all ventilation leadi ng into the accomm odation of choice, machinery spaces and the bridge . A ll personnel should stay away from effluent (see SPILLAGE SCHEDULE S - B) .

MSC.1/Circ.1588/Rev.1 Annex, page 31 I: \ CIRC \ MSC \ 01 \ MSC.1 - CIRC.1588 - Rev.1.docx 12.9.2 Some corrosive substances are also flammable . In these cases, the safety advice for both flammable and corrosiv e substances shoul d be followed . Use of copious quantities of water and water spray is recommended . In general, the flammability hazard is more important than the corrosive properties for t he safety of the shi p and the crew (see e . g . SPILLAGE SCHEDULES S - C and S - G) . 12.10 Miscel laneous dangerous substances and articles and environmentally hazardous substances – class 9 This class contains miscellaneous dangerous substances that do not fit easily under the criteri a for other hazard classes . Nonetheless, these sub stances represent hazards . There are no common properties that apply to all goods of this class . They have been allocated to the relevant EmS SPILLAGE SCHEDULE according to their hazards in the event of a spillage . 12.11 Marine pollutants 12.11.1 A number of substances within all class es have also been designated as marine pollutants because they are hazardous to marine life . Packages containing these substances will bear a marine pollutant mark . 12.11.2 In the case of spi llage, it is important to be aware that any marine pollu tant which is was hed overboard will pollute the sea and must therefore be reported in accordance with the Reporting procedures by the fastest telecommunication chann el available with the highest possi ble priority to the nearest coastal State (see Reporting Procedures) . 12.11.3 It is, however, more important to ensure the safety of the crew and the integrity of the laden ship, rather than to prevent pollution of the sea by marine pollutants .
