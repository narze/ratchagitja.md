- 4 - Preamble 1 The purpose of this Code is to provide an international standard for the safe carriage, by sea in bulk, of liquefied gases and certain other substances that are listed in chapter 19. Through consideration of the products carried, it prescribes the design and construction standards of the ships involved and the equipment they should carry to minimize the risk to the ship, its crew and the environment. 2 The basic philosophy is one of ship types related to the hazards of the products covered by the Code. Each of the products may have one or more hazard properties, which include flammability, toxicity, corrosivity and reactivity. A further possible hazard may arise where products are transported under cryogenic or pressure conditions. 3 Severe collisions or strandings could lead to cargo tank damage and result in uncontrolled release of the product. Such a release could result in evaporation and dispersion of the product and, in some cases, could cause brittle fracture of the ship's hull. The requirements in the Code are intended to minimize this risk as far as is practicable, based upon present knowledge and technology. 4 Throughout the development of the Code, it was recognized that it must be based on sound naval architectural and engineering principles and the best understanding available as to the hazards of the various products covered. Gas carrier design technology is not only a complex technology but is rapidly evolving and the Code shall not remain static. The Organization will periodically review the Code, continually taking into account both experience and future development. 5 Requirements for new products and their conditions of carriage will be circulated as recommendations, on an interim basis, when adopted by the Maritime Safety Committee of the Organization, prior to the entry into force of the appropriate amendments, under the terms of article VIII of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974. 6 The Code primarily deals with ship design and equipment. To ensure the safe transport of the products the total system must, however, be appraised. Other important facets of the safe transport of the products, such as training, operation, traffic control and handling in port, are being or will be examined further by the Organization. 7 The development of the Code has been greatly assisted by a number of organizations in consultative status, such as the Society of International Gas Tanker and Terminal Operators Limited (SIGTTO) and other organizations, such as members of the International Association of Classification Societies (IACS). 8 Chapter 18 of the Code dealing with operation of liquefied gas carriers highlights the regulations in other chapters that are operational in nature and mentions those other important safety features that are peculiar to gas carrier operations. 9 The layout of the Code is in line with the International Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Dangerous Chemicals in Bulk (IBC Code), adopted by the Maritime Safety Committee at its forty-eighth session. Gas carriers may also carry in bulk liquid chemicals covered by the IBC Code, as prescribed in the IGC Code. 10 Floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) facilities, which are designed to handle liquefied gases in bulk, do not fall under the IGC Code. However, designers of such units may consider using the IGC Code to the extent that the Code provides the most appropriate risk mitigation measures for the operations the unit is to perform. Where other more appropriate risk mitigation measures are determined that are contrary to this Code, they shall take precedence over the Code. RESOLUTION MSC.370(93) (adopted on 22 May 2014) AMENDMENTS TO THE INTERNATIONAL CODE FOR THE CONSTRUCTION AND EQUIPMENT OF SHIPS CARRYING LIQUEFIED GASES IN BULK (IGC CODE)

- 5 - CHAPTER 1 GENERAL Goal To provide an international standard for the safe carriage, by sea in bulk, of liquefied gases by laying down the design and construction standards of ships involved in such carriage and the equipment, they shall carry to minimize the risk to the ship, its crew and to the environment, having regard to the nature of the products including flammability, toxicity, asphyxiation, corrosivity, reactivity and low temperature and vapour pressure. 1.1 Application and implementation 1.1.1 The Code applies to ships regardless of their size, including those of less than 500 gross tonnage, engaged in the carriage of liquefied gases having a vapour pressure exceeding 0.28 MPa absolute at a temperature of 37.8°C and other products, as shown in chapter 19, when carried in bulk. 1.1.2.1 Unless expressly provided otherwise, the Code applies to ships whose keels are laid, or which are at a similar stage of construction where: .1 construction identifiable with the ship begins; and .2 assembly of that ship has commenced, comprising at least 50 tonnes or 1% of the estimated mass of all structural material, whichever is less, on or after 1 July 2016. 1.1.2.2 For the purpose of the Code, the expression "ships constructed" means ships the keels of which are laid or which are at a similar stage of construction. 1.1.2.3 Unless expressly provided otherwise, for ships constructed on or after 1 July 1986 and before 1 July 2016, the Administration shall ensure that the requirements which are applicable under this Code, as adopted by resolution MSC.5(48) as amended by resolutions MSC.17(58), MSC.30(61), MSC.32(63), MSC.59(67), MSC.103(73), MSC.177(79) and MSC.220(82), are complied with. 1.1.3 A ship, irrespective of the date of construction, which is converted to a gas carrier on or after 1 July 2016, shall be treated as a gas carrier constructed on the date on which such conversion commences. 1.1.4.1 When cargo tanks contain products for which the Code requires a type 1G ship, neither flammable liquids having a flashpoint of 60°C (closed cup test) or less, nor flammable products listed in chapter 19, shall be carried in tanks located within the protective zones described in 2.4.1.1. 1.1.4.2 Similarly, when cargo tanks contain products for which the Code requires a type 2G/2PG ship, the flammable liquids as described in 1.1.4.1, shall not be carried in tanks located within the protective zones described in 2.4.1.2. 1.1.4.3 In each case, for cargo tanks loaded with products for which the Code requires a type 1G or 2G/2PG ship, the restriction applies to the protective zones within the longitudinal extent of the hold spaces for those tanks.

CHAPTER 2 SHIP SURVIVAL CAPABILITY AND LOCATION OF CARGO TANKS Goal To ensure that the cargo tanks are in a protective location in the event of minor hull damage, and that the ship can survive the assumed flooding conditions. 2.1 General 2.1.1 Ships subject to the Code shall survive the hydrostatic effects of flooding following assumed hull damage caused by some external force. In addition, to safeguard the ship and the environment, the cargo tanks shall be protected from penetration in the case of minor damage to the ship resulting, for example, from contact with a jetty or tug, and also given a measure of protection from damage in the case of collision or grounding, by locating them at specified minimum distances inboard from the ship's shell plating. Both the damage to be assumed and the proximity of the tanks to the ship's shell shall be dependent upon the degree of hazard presented by the product to be carried. In addition, the proximity of the cargo tanks to the ship's shell shall be dependent upon the volume of the cargo tank. 2.1.2 Ships subject to the Code shall be designed to one of the following standards: .1 A type 1G ship is a gas carrier intended to transport the products indicated in chapter 19 that require maximum preventive measures to preclude their escape. .2 A type 2G ship is a gas carrier intended to transport the products indicated in chapter 19, that require significant preventive measures to preclude their escape. .3 A type 2PG ship is a gas carrier of 150 m in length or less intended to transport the products indicated in chapter 19 that require significant preventive measures to preclude their escape, and where the products are carried in type C independent tanks designed (see 4.23) for a MARVS of at least 0.7 MPa gauge and a cargo containment system design temperature of -55°C or above. A ship of this description that is over 150 m in length is to be considered a type 2G ship. .4 A type 3G ship is a gas carrier intended to carry the products indicated in chapter 19 that require moderate preventive measures to preclude their escape. Therefore, a type 1G ship is a gas carrier intended for the transportation of products considered to present the greatest overall hazard and types 2G/2PG and type 3G for products of progressively lesser hazards. Accordingly, a type 1G ship shall survive the most severe standard of damage and its cargo tanks shall be located at the maximum prescribed distance inboard from the shell plating. 2.1.3 The ship type required for individual products is indicated in column " c " in the table of chapter 19. RESOLUTION MSC.370(93) (adopted on 22 May 2014) AMENDMENTS TO THE INTERNATIONAL CODE FOR THE CONSTRUCTION AND EQUIPMENT OF SHIPS CARRYING LIQUEFIED GASES IN BULK (IGC CODE)

- 18 - 2.1.4 If a ship is intended to carry more than one of the products listed in chapter 19, the standard of damage shall correspond to the product having the most stringent ship type requirements. The requirements for the location of individual cargo tanks, however, are those for ship types related to the respective products intended to be carried. 2.1.5 For the purpose of this Code, the position of the moulded line for different containment systems is shown in figures 2.5 (a) to (e). 2.2 Freeboard and stability 2.2.1 Ships subject to the Code may be assigned the minimum freeboard permitted by the International Convention on Load Lines in force. However, the draught associated with the assignment shall not be greater than the maximum draught otherwise permitted by this Code. 2.2.2 The stability of the ship, in all seagoing conditions and during loading and unloading cargo, shall comply with the requirements of the International Code on Intact Stability. This includes partial filling and loading and unloading at sea, when applicable. Stability during ballast water operations shall fulfil stability criteria. 2.2.3 When calculating the effect of free surfaces of consumable liquids for loading conditions, it shall be assumed that, for each type of liquid, at least one transverse pair or a single centre tank has a free surface. The tank or combination of tanks to be taken into account shall be those where the effect of free surfaces is the greatest. The free surface effect in undamaged compartments shall be calculated by a method according to the International Code on Intact Stability. 2.2.4 Solid ballast shall not normally be used in double bottom spaces in the cargo area. Where, however, because of stability considerations, the fitting of solid ballast in such spaces becomes unavoidable, its disposition shall be governed by the need to enable access for inspection and to ensure that the impact loads resulting from bottom damage are not directly transmitted to the cargo tank structure. 2.2.5 The master of the ship shall be supplied with a loading and stability information booklet. This booklet shall contain details of typical service conditions, loading, unloading and ballasting operations, provisions for evaluating other conditions of loading and a summary of the ship's survival capabilities. The booklet shall also contain sufficient information to enable the master to load and operate the ship in a safe and seaworthy manner. 2.2.6 All ships, subject to the Code shall be fitted with a stability instrument, capable of verifying compliance with intact and damage stability requirements, approved by the Administration having regard to the performance standards recommended by the Organization. .1 ships constructed before 1 July 2016 shall comply with this paragraph at the first scheduled renewal survey of the ship after 1 July 2016 but not later than 1 July 2021; .2 notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph 2.2.6.1 a stability instrument installed on a ship constructed before 1 July 2016 need not be replaced provided it is capable of verifying compliance with intact and damage stability, to the satisfaction of the Administration; and .3 for the purposes of control under SOLAS regulation XI-1/4, the Administration shall issue a document of approval for the stability instrument.

Hold spaces shall be located forward of machinery spaces of category A. Alternative arrangements, including locating machinery spaces of category A forward, may be accepted, based on SOLAS regulation II-2/17, after further consideration of involved risks, including that of cargo release and the means of mitigation. 3.1.2 Where cargo is carried in a cargo containment system not requiring a complete or partial secondary barrier, segregation of hold spaces from spaces referred to in 3.1.1 or spaces either below or outboard of the hold spaces may be effected by cofferdams, oil fuel tanks or a single gastight bulkhead of all-welded construction forming an "A-60" class division. A gastight "A-0" class division is acceptable if there is no source of ignition or fire hazard in the adjoining spaces. 3.1.3 Where cargo is carried in a cargo containment system requiring a complete or partial secondary barrier, segregation of hold spaces from spaces referred to in 3.1.1, or spaces either below or outboard of the hold spaces that contain a source of ignition or fire hazard, shall be effected by cofferdams or oil fuel tanks. A gastight "A-0" class division is acceptable if there is no source of ignition or fire hazard in the adjoining spaces. 3.1.4 Turret compartments segregation from spaces referred to in 3.1.1, or spaces either below or outboard of the turret compartment that contain a source of ignition or fire hazard, shall be effected by cofferdams or an A-60 class division. A gastight "A-0" class division is acceptable if there is no source of ignition or fire hazard in the adjoining spaces. 3.1.5 In addition, the risk of fire propagation from turret compartments to adjacent spaces shall be evaluated by a risk analysis (see 1.1.11) and further preventive measures, such as the arrangement of a cofferdam around the turret compartment, shall be provided if needed. 3.1.6 When cargo is carried in a cargo containment system requiring a complete or partial secondary barrier: .1 at temperatures below -10 o C, hold spaces shall be segregated from the sea by a double bottom; and .2 at temperatures below -55 o C, the ship shall also have a longitudinal bulkhead forming side tanks. 3.1.7 Arrangements shall be made for sealing the weather decks in way of openings for cargo containment systems.

When carrying toxic products, they shall be capable of being operated from inside the space. The requirement for fitting air intakes and openings with closing devices operated from inside the space for toxic products need not apply to spaces not normally manned, such as deck stores, forecastle stores, workshops. In addition, the requirement does not apply to cargo control rooms located within the cargo area. 3.2.7 Control rooms and machinery spaces of turret systems may be located in the cargo area forward or aft of cargo tanks in ships with such installations. Access to such spaces containing sources of ignition may be permitted through doors facing the cargo area, provided the doors are located outside hazardous areas or access is through airlocks.

- 41 - CHAPTER 4 CARGO CONTAINMENT Goal To ensure the safe containment of cargo under all design and operating conditions having regard to the nature of the cargo carried. This will include measures to: .1 provide strength to withstand defined loads; .2 maintain the cargo in a liquid state; .3 design for or protect the hull structure from low temperature exposure; and .4 prevent the ingress of water or air into the cargo containment system. 4.1 Definitions 4.1.1 A cold spot is a part of the hull or thermal insulation surface where a localized temperature decrease occurs with respect to the allowable minimum temperature of the hull or of its adjacent hull structure, or to design capabilities of cargo pressure/temperature control systems required in chapter 7. 4.1.2 Design vapour pressure " P 0 " is the maximum gauge pressure, at the top of the tank, to be used in the design of the tank. 4.1.3 Design temperature for selection of materials is the minimum temperature at which cargo may be loaded or transported in the cargo tanks. 4.1.4 Independent tanks are self-supporting tanks. They do not form part of the ship's hull and are not essential to the hull strength. There are three categories of independent tank, which are referred to in 4.21, 4.22 and 4.23. 4.1.5 Membrane tanks are non-self-supporting tanks that consist of a thin liquid and gastight layer (membrane) supported through insulation by the adjacent hull structure. Membrane tanks are covered in 4.24. 4.1.6 Integral tanks are tanks that form a structural part of the hull and are influenced in the same manner by the loads that stress the adjacent hull structure. Integral tanks are covered in 4.25. 4.1.7 Semi-membrane tanks are non-self-supporting tanks in the loaded condition and consist of a layer, parts of which are supported through insulation by the adjacent hull structure. Semi-membrane tanks are covered in 4.26. 4.1.8 In addition to the definitions in 1.2, the definitions given in this chapter shall apply throughout the Code. 4.2 Application Unless otherwise specified in part E, the requirements of parts A to D shall apply to all types of tanks, including those covered in part F.

- 42 - P ART A C ARGO CONTAINMENT 4.3 Functional requirements 4.3.1 The design life of the cargo containment system shall not be less than the design life of the ship. 4.3.2 Cargo containment systems shall be designed for North Atlantic environmental conditions and relevant long-term sea state scatter diagrams for unrestricted navigation. Lesser environmental conditions, consistent with the expected usage, may be accepted by the Administration for cargo containment systems used exclusively for restricted navigation. Greater environmental conditions may be required for cargo containment systems operated in conditions more severe than the North Atlantic environment. 4.3.3 Cargo containment systems shall be designed with suitable safety margins: .1 to withstand, in the intact condition, the environmental conditions anticipated for the cargo containment system's design life and the loading conditions appropriate for them, which include full homogeneous and partial load conditions, partial filling within defined limits and ballast voyage loads; and .2 being appropriate for uncertainties in loads, structural modelling, fatigue, corrosion, thermal effects, material variability, ageing and construction tolerances. 4.3.4 The cargo containment system structural strength shall be assessed against failure modes, including but not limited to plastic deformation, buckling and fatigue. The specific design conditions which shall be considered for the design of each cargo containment system are given in 4.21 to 4.26. There are three main categories of design conditions: .1 Ultimate design conditions – the cargo containment system structure and its structural components shall withstand loads liable to occur during its construction, testing and anticipated use in service, without loss of structural integrity. The design shall take into account proper combinations of the following loads: .1 internal pressure; .2 external pressure; .3 dynamic loads due to the motion of the ship; .4 thermal loads; .5 sloshing loads; .6 loads corresponding to ship deflections; .7 tank and cargo weight with the corresponding reaction in way of supports; .8 insulation weight; .9 loads in way of towers and other attachments; and .10 test loads.

Measures may include, but are not limited to, material selection, coatings, corrosion additions, cathodic protection and inerting. Corrosion allowance need not be required in addition to the thickness resulting from the structural analysis. However, where there is no environmental control, such as inerting around the cargo tank, or where the cargo is of a corrosive nature, the Administration or recognized organization acting on its behalf may require a suitable corrosion allowance. 4.3.6 An inspection/survey plan for the cargo containment system shall be developed and approved by the Administration or recognized organization acting on its behalf. The inspection/survey plan shall identify areas that need inspection during surveys throughout the cargo containment system's life and, in particular, all necessary in-service survey and maintenance that was assumed when selecting cargo containment system design parameters. Cargo containment systems shall be designed, constructed and equipped to provide adequate means of access to areas that need inspection as specified in the inspection/survey plan. Cargo containment systems, including all associated internal equipment, shall be designed and built to ensure safety during operations, inspection and maintenance (see 3.5). 4.4 Cargo containment safety principles 4.4.1 The containment systems shall be provided with a full secondary liquid-tight barrier capable of safely containing all potential leakages through the primary barrier and, in conjunction with the thermal insulation system, of preventing lowering of the temperature of the ship structure to an unsafe level. 4.4.2 However, the size and configuration or arrangement of the secondary barrier may be reduced where an equivalent level of safety is demonstrated in accordance with the requirements of 4.4.3 to 4.4.5, as applicable. 4.4.3 Cargo containment systems for which the probability for structural failures to develop into a critical state has been determined to be extremely low, but where the possibility of leakages through the primary barrier cannot be excluded, shall be equipped with a partial secondary barrier and small leak protection system capable of safely handling and disposing of the leakages. The arrangements shall comply with the following requirements: .1 failure developments that can be reliably detected before reaching a critical state (e.g. by gas detection or inspection) shall have a sufficiently long development time for remedial actions to be taken; and RESOLUTION MSC.370(93) (adopted on 22 May 2014) AMENDMENTS TO THE INTERNATIONAL CODE FOR THE CONSTRUCTION AND EQUIPMENT OF SHIPS CARRYING LIQUEFIED GASES IN BULK (IGC CODE)

The small leak protection system shall include means to detect a leak in the primary barrier, provision such as a spray shield to deflect any liquid cargo down into the partial secondary barrier, and means to dispose of the liquid, which may be by natural evaporation. 4.7.2 The capacity of the partial secondary barrier shall be determined, based on the cargo leakage corresponding to the extent of failure resulting from the load spectrum referred to in 4.18.2.6, after the initial detection of a primary leak. Due account may be taken of liquid evaporation, rate of leakage, pumping capacity and other relevant factors. 4.7.3 The required liquid leakage detection may be by means of liquid sensors, or by an effective use of pressure, temperature or gas detection systems, or any combination thereof. 4.8 Supporting arrangements 4.8.1 The cargo tanks shall be supported by the hull in a manner that prevents bodily movement of the tank under the static and dynamic loads defined in 4.12 to 4.15, where applicable, while allowing contraction and expansion of the tank under temperature variations and hull deflections without undue stressing of the tank and the hull. 4.8.2 Anti-flotation arrangements shall be provided for independent tanks and capable of withstanding the loads defined in 4.15.2 without plastic deformation likely to endanger the hull structure.

Cargo containment system design according to this section shall be based on the principles of limit state design which is an approach to structural design that can be applied to established design solutions as well as novel designs. This more generic approach maintains a level of safety similar to that achieved for known containment systems as designed using 4.21 to 4.26. 4.27.2.1 The limit state design is a systematic approach where each structural element is evaluated with respect to possible failure modes related to the design conditions identified in 4.3.4. A limit state can be defined as a condition beyond which the structure, or part of a structure, no longer satisfies the requirements. 4.27.2.2 For each failure mode, one or more limit states may be relevant. By consideration of all relevant limit states, the limit load for the structural element is found as the minimum limit load resulting from all the relevant limit states. The limit states are divided into the three following categories: .1 Ultimate limit states (ULS), which correspond to the maximum load-carrying capacity or, in some cases, to the maximum applicable strain or deformation; under intact (undamaged) conditions. .2 Fatigue limit states (FLS), which correspond to degradation due to the effect of time varying (cyclic) loading. .3 Accident limit states (ALS), which concern the ability of the structure to resist accidental situations. 4.27.3 The procedure and relevant design parameters of the limit state design shall comply with the Standards for the Use of limit state methodologies in the design of cargo containment systems of novel configuration (LSD Standard), as set out in appendix 5.

The basic characteristic of a primary stress is that it is not self-limiting. Primary stresses that considerably exceed the yield strength will result in failure or at least in gross deformations. 4.28.3.7 Primary general membrane stress is a primary membrane stress that is so distributed in the structure that no redistribution of load occurs as a result of yielding. 4.28.3.8 Primary local membrane stress arises where a membrane stress produced by pressure or other mechanical loading and associated with a primary or a discontinuity effect produces excessive distortion in the transfer of loads for other portions of the structure. Such a stress is classified as a primary local membrane stress, although it has some characteristics of a secondary stress. A stress region may be considered as local, if: Rt S 5 . 0 1  and Rt S 5 . 2 2  , where: S 1 = distance in the meridional direction over which the equivalent stress exceeds 1.1 f ; S 2 = distance in the meridional direction to another region where the limits for primary general membrane stress are exceeded; R = mean radius of the vessel; t = wall thickness of the vessel at the location where the primary general membrane stress limit is exceeded; and f = allowable primary general membrane stress.

- 92 - 6.1.4 Controlled rolling (CR) is a rolling procedure in which the final deformation is carried out in the normalizing temperature range, resulting in a material condition generally equivalent to that obtained by normalizing. 6.1.5 Thermo-mechanical controlled processing (TMCP) is a procedure that involves strict control of both the steel temperature and the rolling reduction. Unlike CR, the properties conferred by TMCP cannot be reproduced by subsequent normalizing or other heat treatment. The use of accelerated cooling on completion of TMCP may also be accepted, subject to approval by the Administration. The same applies for the use of tempering after completion of TMCP. 6.1.6 Accelerated cooling (AcC) is a process that aims to improve mechanical properties by controlled cooling with rates higher than air cooling, immediately after the final TMCP operation. Direct quenching is excluded from accelerated cooling. The material properties conferred by TMCP and AcC cannot be reproduced by subsequent normalizing or other heat treatment. 6.2 Scope and general requirements 6.2.1 This chapter gives the requirements for metallic and non-metallic materials used in the construction of the cargo system.

These cargoes may variously be referred to as "Crude C4", "Crude butadiene", "Crude steam-cracked C4", "Spent steam-cracked C4", "C4 stream", "C4 raffinate", or may be shipped under a different description. In all cases, the material safety data sheets (MSDS) shall be consulted as the butadiene content of the mixture is of prime concern as it is potentially toxic and reactive. While it is recognized that butadiene has a relatively low vapour pressure, if such mixtures contain butadiene they shall be regarded as toxic and the appropriate precautions applied. 17.20.2 If the mixed C4 cargo shipped under the terms of this section contains more than 50% (mole) of butadiene, the inhibitor precautions in 17.8 shall apply. 17.20.3 Unless specific data on liquid expansion coefficients is given for the specific mixture loaded, the filling limit restrictions of chapter 15 shall be calculated as if the cargo contained 100% concentration of the component with the highest expansion ratio. 17.21 Carbon dioxide: high purity 17.21.1 Uncontrolled pressure loss from the cargo can cause "sublimation" and the cargo will change from the liquid to the solid state. The precise "triple point" temperature of a particular carbon dioxide cargo shall be supplied before loading the cargo, and will depend on the purity of that cargo, and this shall be taken into account when cargo instrumentation is adjusted. The set pressure for the alarms and automatic actions described in this section shall be set to at least 0.05 MPa above the triple point for the specific cargo being carried. The "triple point" for pure carbon dioxide occurs at 0.5 MPa gauge and -54.4°C. 17.21.2 There is a potential for the cargo to solidify in the event that a cargo tank relief valve, fitted in accordance with 8.2, fails in the open position. To avoid this, a means of isolating the cargo tank safety valves shall be provided and the requirements of 8.2.9.2 do not apply when carrying this carbon dioxide. Discharge piping from safety relief valves shall be designed so they remain free from obstructions that could cause clogging. Protective screens shall not be fitted to the outlets of relief valve discharge piping, so the requirements of 8.2.15 do not apply. 17.21.3 Discharge piping from safety relief valves are not required to comply with 8.2.10, but shall be designed so they remain free from obstructions that could cause clogging. Protective screens shall not be fitted to the outlets of relief valve discharge piping, so the requirements of 8.2.15 do not apply. 17.21.4 Cargo tanks shall be continuously monitored for low pressure when a carbon dioxide cargo is carried. An audible and visual alarm shall be given at the cargo control position and on the bridge. If the cargo tank pressure continues to fall to within 0.05 MPa of the "triple point" for the particular cargo, the monitoring system shall automatically close all cargo manifold liquid and vapour valves and stop all cargo compressors and cargo pumps. The emergency shutdown system required by 18.10 may be used for this purpose. 17.21.5 All materials used in cargo tanks and cargo piping system shall be suitable for the lowest temperature that may occur in service, which is defined as the saturation temperature of the carbon dioxide cargo at the set pressure of the automatic safety system described in 17.21.1.

- 180 - APPENDIX 4 NON-METALLIC MATERIALS 1 General 1.1 The guidance given in this appendix is in addition to the requirements of 4.19, where applicable to non-metallic materials. 1.2 The manufacture, testing, inspection and documentation of non-metallic materials should in general comply with recognized standards, and with the specific requirements of this Code, as applicable. 1.3 When selecting a non-metallic material, the designer should ensure that it has properties appropriate to the analysis and specification of the system requirements. A material can be selected to fulfil one or more requirements. 1.4 A wide range of non-metallic materials may be considered. Therefore, the section below on material selection criteria cannot cover every eventuality and should be considered as guidance. 2 Material selection criteria 2.1 Non-metallic materials may be selected for use in various parts of liquefied gas carrier cargo systems based on consideration of the following basic properties: .1 insulation – the ability to limit heat flow; .2 load bearing – the ability to contribute to the strength of the containment system; .3 tightness – the ability to provide liquid and vapour tight barriers; .4 joining – the ability to be joined (for example by bonding, welding or fastening). 2.2 Additional considerations may apply depending on the specific system design. 3 Properties of materials 3.1 Flexibility of insulating material is the ability of an insulating material to be bent or shaped easily without damage or breakage. 3.2 Loose fill material is a homogeneous solid generally in the form of fine particles, such as a powder or beads, normally used to fill the voids in an inaccessible space to provide an effective insulation. 3.3 Nanomaterial is a material with properties derived from its specific microscopic structure. 3.4 Cellular material is a material type containing cells that are either open, closed or both and which are dispersed throughout its mass. 3.5 Adhesive material is a product that joins or bonds two adjacent surfaces together by an adhesive process. 3.6 Other materials are materials that are not characterized in this section of the Code and should be identified and listed. The relevant tests used to evaluate the suitability of material for use in the cargo system should be identified and documented. RESOLUTION MSC.370(93) (adopted on 22 May 2014) AMENDMENTS TO THE INTERNATIONAL CODE FOR THE CONSTRUCTION AND EQUIPMENT OF SHIPS CARRYING LIQUEFIED GASES IN BULK (IGC CODE)

- 181 - 4 Material selection and testing requirements 4.1 Material specification 4.1.1 When the initial selection of a material has been made, tests should be conducted to validate the suitability of this material for the use intended. 4.1.2 The material used should clearly be identified and the relevant tests should be fully documented. 4.1.3 Materials should be selected according to their intended use. They should: .1 be compatible with all the products that may be carried; .2 not be contaminated by any cargo nor react with it; .3 not have any characteristics or properties affected by the cargo; and .4 be capable to withstand thermal shocks within the operating temperature range. 4.2 Material testing The tests required for a particular material depend on the design analysis, specification and intended duty. The list of tests below is for illustration. Any additional tests required, for example in respect of sliding, damping and galvanic insulation, should be identified clearly and documented. Materials selected according to 4.1 of this appendix should be tested further according to the following table: Function Insulation Load bearing structural Tightness Joining Mechanical tests X X Tightness tests X Thermal tests X Thermal shock testing should submit the material and/or assembly to the most extreme thermal gradient it will experience when in service. 4.2.1 Inherent properties of materials 4.2.1.1 Tests should be carried out to ensure that the inherent properties of the material selected will not have any negative impact in respect of the use intended. 4.2.1.2 For all selected materials, the following properties should be evaluated: .1 density; example standard ISO 845; and .2 linear coefficient of thermal expansion (LCTE); example standard ISO 11359 across the widest specified operating temperature range. However, for loose fill material the volumetric coefficient of thermal expansion (VCTE) should be evaluated, as this is more relevant. 4.2.1.3 Irrespective of its inherent properties and intended duty, all materials selected should be tested for the design service temperature range down to 5°C below the minimum design temperature, but not lower than -196°C.

- 182 - 4.2.1.4 Each property evaluation test should be performed in accordance with recognized standards. Where there are no such standards, the test procedure proposed should be fully detailed and submitted to the Administration for acceptance. Sampling should be sufficient to ensure a true representation of the properties of the material selected. 4.2.2 Mechanical tests 4.2.2.1 The mechanical tests should be performed in accordance with the following table. ISO 527 ISO 1421 ISO 3346 ISO 1926 ISO 4587 ISO 3347 ISO 1922 ISO 6237 ISO 604 ISO 844 ISO 3132 ISO 3133 ISO 14679 ISO 7850 Load bearing structural Creep Tensile Shearing Compressive Bending Mechanical tests 4.2.2.2 If the chosen function for a material relies on particular properties such as tensile, compressive and shear strength, yield stress, modulus or elongation, these properties should be tested to a recognized standard. If the properties required are assessed by numerical simulation according to a high order behaviour law, the testing should be performed to the satisfaction of the Administration. 4.2.2.3 Creep may be caused by sustained loads, for example cargo pressure or structural loads. Creep testing should be conducted based on the loads expected to be encountered during the design life of the containment system. 4.2.3 Tightness tests 4.2.3.1 The tightness requirement for the material should relate to its operational functionality. 4.2.3.2 Tightness tests should be conducted to give a measurement of the material's permeability in the configuration corresponding to the application envisaged (e.g. thickness and stress conditions) using the fluid to be retained (e.g. cargo, water vapour or trace gas).

- 183 - 4.2.3.3 The tightness tests should be based on the tests indicated as examples in the following table. Tightness tests Tightness Porosity/Permeability ISO 15106 ISO 2528 ISO 2782 4.2.4 Thermal conductivity tests 4.2.4.1 Thermal conductivity tests should be representative of the lifecycle of the insulation material so its properties over the design life of the cargo system can be assessed. If these properties are likely to deteriorate over time, the material should be aged as best possible in an environment corresponding to its lifecycle, for example operating temperature, light, vapour and installation (e.g. packaging, bags, boxes, etc.). 4.2.4.2 Requirements for the absolute value and acceptable range of thermal conductivity and heat capacity should be chosen taking into account the effect on the operational efficiency of the cargo containment system. Particular attention should also be paid to the sizing of the associated cargo handling system and components such as safety relief valves plus vapour return and handling equipment. 4.2.4.3 Thermal tests should be based on the tests indicated as examples in the following table or their equivalents: 4.2.5 Physical tests 4.2.5.1 In addition to the requirements of 4.19.2.3 and 4.19.3.2, the following table provides guidance and information on some of the additional physical tests that may be considered.

This programme should consider the material starting from the manufacturer's quality manual (QM) and then follow it throughout the construction of the cargo system. 5.1.2 The QA/QC programme should include the procedure for fabrication, storage, handling and preventive actions to guard against exposure of a material to harmful effects. These may include, for example, the effect of sunlight on some insulation materials or the contamination of material surfaces by contact with personal products such as hand creams. The sampling methods and the frequency of testing in the QA/QC programme should be specified to ensure the continued conformity of the material selected throughout its production and installation. 5.1.3 Where powder or granulated insulation is produced, arrangements should be made to prevent compacting of the material due to vibrations.

- 187 - APPENDIX 5 STANDARD FOR THE USE OF LIMIT STATE METHODOLOGIES IN THE DESIGN OF CARGO CONTAINMENT SYSTEMS OF NOVEL CONFIGURATION 1 General 1.1 The purpose of this standard is to provide procedures and relevant design parameters of limit state design of cargo containment systems of a novel configuration in accordance with section 4.27 of this Code. 1.2 Limit state design is a systematic approach where each structural element is evaluated with respect to possible failure modes related to the design conditions identified in section 4.3.4 of this Code. A limit state can be defined as a condition beyond which the structure, or part of a structure, no longer satisfies the requirements. 1.3 The limit states are divided into the three following categories: .1 Ultimate Limit States (ULS), which correspond to the maximum load- carrying capacity or, in some cases, to the maximum applicable strain, deformation or instability in structure resulting from buckling and plastic collapse; under intact (undamaged) conditions; .2 Fatigue Limit States (FLS), which correspond to degradation due to the effect of cyclic loading; and .3 Accident Limit States (ALS), which concern the ability of the structure to resist accident situations. 1.4 Part A through part D of chapter 4 of this Code shall be complied with as applicable depending on the cargo containment system concept. 2 Design format 2.1 The design format in this standard is based on a Load and Resistance Factor Design format. The fundamental principle of the Load and Resistance Factor Design format is to verify that design load effects, d L , do not exceed design resistances, d R , for any of the considered failure modes in any scenario: d d L R  A design load dk F is obtained by multiplying the characteristic load by a load factor relevant for the given load category: dk f k F F    where: f  is load factor; and k F is the characteristic load as specified in part B and part C of chapter 4 of this Code. RESOLUTION MSC.370(93) (adopted on 22 May 2014) AMENDMENTS TO THE INTERNATIONAL CODE FOR THE CONSTRUCTION AND EQUIPMENT OF SHIPS CARRYING LIQUEFIED GASES IN BULK (IGC CODE)

- 188 - A design load effect d L (e.g. stresses, strains, displacements and vibrations) is the most unfavourable combined load effect derived from the design loads, and may be expressed by:   1 2 , ,..., d d d dN L q F F F  where q denotes the functional relationship between load and load effect determined by structural analyses. The design resistance d R is determined as follows: k d R C R R     where: k R is the characteristic resistance. In case of materials covered by chapter 6 of this Code, it may be, but not limited to, specified minimum yield stress, specified minimum tensile strength, plastic resistance of cross sections, and ultimate buckling strength; R  is the resistance factor, defined as R m s      ; m  is the partial resistance factor to take account of the probabilistic distribution of the material properties (material factor); s  is the partial resistance factor to take account of the uncertainties on the capacity of the structure, such as the quality of the construction, method considered for determination of the capacity including accuracy of analysis; and C  is the consequence class factor, which accounts for the potential results of failure with regard to release of cargo and possible human injury. 2.2 Cargo containment design shall take into account potential failure consequences. Consequence classes are defined in table 1, to specify the consequences of failure when the mode of failure is related to the Ultimate Limit State, the Fatigue Limit State, or the Accident Limit State. Table 1: Consequence classes Consequence class Definition Low Failure implies minor release of the cargo. Medium Failure implies release of the cargo and potential for human injury. High Failure implies significant rel ease of the cargo and high potential for human injury/fatality. 3 Required analyses 3.1 Three dimensional finite element analyses shall be carried out as an integrated model of the tank and the ship hull, including supports and keying system as applicable. All the failure modes shall be identified to avoid unexpected failures. Hydrodynamic analyses shall be carried out to determine the particular ship accelerations and motions in irregular waves, and the response of the ship and its cargo containment systems to these forces and motions. RESOLUTION MSC.370(93) (adopted on 22 May 2014) AMENDMENTS TO THE INTERNATIONAL CODE FOR THE CONSTRUCTION AND EQUIPMENT OF SHIPS CARRYING LIQUEFIED GASES IN BULK (IGC CODE)

- 189 - 3.2 Buckling strength analyses of cargo tanks subject to external pressure and other loads causing compressive stresses shall be carried out in accordance with recognized standards. The method shall adequately account for the difference in theoretical and actual buckling stress as a result of plate out of flatness, plate edge misalignment, straightness, ovality and deviation from true circular form over a specified arc or chord length, as relevant. 3.3 Fatigue and crack propagation analysis shall be carried out in accordance with paragraph 5.1 of this standard. 4 Ultimate Limit States 4.1 Structural resistance may be established by testing or by complete analysis taking account of both elastic and plastic material properties. Safety margins for ultimate strength shall be introduced by partial factors of safety taking account of the contribution of stochastic nature of loads and resistance (dynamic loads, pressure loads, gravity loads, material strength, and buckling capacities). 4.2 Appropriate combinations of permanent loads, functional loads and environmental loads including sloshing loads shall be considered in the analysis. At least two load combinations with partial load factors as given in table 2 shall be used for the assessment of the ultimate limit states. Table 2: Partial load factors Load combination Permanent loads Functional loads Environmental loads ' a ' ' b ' 1.1 1.0 1.1 1.0 0.7 1.3 The load factors for permanent and functional loads in load combination ' a ' are relevant for the normally well-controlled and/or specified loads applicable to cargo containment systems such as vapour pressure, cargo weight, system self-weight, etc. Higher load factors may be relevant for permanent and functional loads where the inherent variability and/or uncertainties in the prediction models are higher. 4.3 For sloshing loads, depending on the reliability of the estimation method, a larger load factor may be required by the Administration or recognized organization acting on its behalf. 4.4 In cases where structural failure of the cargo containment system are considered to imply high potential for human injury and significant release of cargo, the consequence class factor shall be taken as 2 . 1  C  . This value may be reduced if it is justified through risk analysis and subject to the approval by the Administration or recognized organization acting on its behalf. The risk analysis shall take account of factors including, but not limited to, provision of full or partial secondary barrier to protect hull structure from the leakage and less hazards associated with intended cargo. Conversely, higher values may be fixed by the Administration or recognized organization acting on its behalf, for example, for ships carrying more hazardous or higher pressure cargo. The consequence class factor shall in any case not be less than 1.0. 4.5 The load factors and the resistance factors used shall be such that the level of safety is equivalent to that of the cargo containment systems as described in sections 4.21 to 4.26 of this Code. This may be carried out by calibrating the factors against known successful designs.

When membrane stress is significant, the effect of the membrane stress on the plate bending capacity shall be appropriately considered in addition. 4.8.4 Section stress categories Normal stress is the component of stress normal to the plane of reference. Equivalent section membrane stress is the component of the normal stress that is uniformly distributed and equal to the average value of the stress across the cross section of the structure under consideration. If this is a simple shell section, the section membrane stress is identical to the membrane stress defined in paragraph 4.8.2 of this standard. Section bending stress is the component of the normal stress that is linearly distributed over a structural section exposed to bending action, as illustrated in figure 1.
